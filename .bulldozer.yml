  # Allows the merge method that is used when auto-merging a PR to be different based on the
  # target branch. The keys of the hash are the target branch name, and the values are the merge method that
  # will be used for PRs targeting that branch. The valid values are the same as for the "method" key.
  # Note: If the target branch does not match any of the specified keys, the "method" key is used instead.

      # "pull_request_title".
