# v0.34 P2P Communicaton layer

Within a Tendermint network, nodes can communicate with one another using a p2p protocol. The goal of this document is to specify the p2p layer in Tendermint v0.34 including: Peer discovery, peer management, connection handling and message types. 

## Introduction 
This documentation aims at separating the logical components on a protocol level from the implementation details of each protocol. 

At a high level, the p2p layer in Tendermint has the following main functionalities:
1. Peer management: peer discovery and peer ranking
2. Peer connection handling: dialing and accepting connections
3. Message transfer
   
The implementation of these three functionalities is split between different Tendermint components as shown in the tables below. 
<!--
ToDo Check that the split in tables corresponds to what is actually in the files.

### Peer lifecycle

A Node can pass through various states before becoming the peer of another node as demonstrated below on the example of an outbound peer:

A node can be in the following states before connecting to its peer:
- 'Candidate': peers that we have not connected to yet but are discovered. (no explicit list)
- ['Dialing'](switch.md#dialing-peers) : peers who are currently being dialed. ( I did not see where this is of particular use. )
- 'Peers' : Connected peers (effectivley a connected state). Peers who a node has successfully dialed or from whom it has [accepted a connection](switch.md#accepting-peers).
- ['Reconnecting'](switch.md#reconnect-to-peer): Peers to whom a node is currently reconnecting. The node is trying to establish a connection to these peers and is failing to do so. After a certain amount of time, the peer is simply dropped to be discovered again by the PEX reactor. 
- ['BadPeers'](addressbook.md#bad-peers) : This is the only list not kept by the switch. It is stored within the addressbook of the PEX reactor. It contains the list of peers that were marked as bad due to exhibited [misbehavior](pex-protocol.md#misbehavior). Peers can be reinstated after being marked as bad. 

This specification explains the conditions that need to be satisfied for a node to transition between these state.



### Node types

From a p2p perspective, within a network, Tendermint distinguishes between regular and [seed nodes](pex-protocol.md#seed-nodes). 
While regular nodes try to form connections between one another, the main role of a seed node is to provide other nodes with addresses. 


## Documentation overview

We organize this specification as follows:

1. [Peer manager](peer_manager.md) describes the high level functionality that a peer manager should provide. It contains pointers to the implementation of relevant functions and their descriptions. 
2. Peer discovery is implemented within the [Pex reactor](pex.md), but we explain the main functionalities abstracted away from the implementation as the [Pex protocol](pex-protocol.md).
3. The [Switch](switch.md) is a service that handles peer connections and exposes an API to receive incoming messages 
on `Reactors`.
4. Tendermint uses an [Address book](addressbook.md) to store peer information and can be viewed as a database. However, the address book also provides the implementation of additional funcationality: peer ranking, peer selection and persistence of peer addresses. 
5. [Transport](transport.md) describes the functions called by other p2p components to actually establishe secure and authenticated connections with peers.
6. Finally, [Types](types.md) and [Configuration](configuration.md) provide a list of existing types and configuration parameters used by the Tendermint p2p layer.

### Peer discovery

Peers are discovered by adding addresses provided in the config file or triggering dials to seed nodes or nodes in the address book. 

When a node is started, it provides the list of persistent peers to the switch by calling `DialPeersAsync`.

Depending on whether the node is a seed node or or not, the PEX reactor constantly runs either `crawlPeersRoutine` or `ensurePeers()` respectively. 

If the node is a seed node, `crawlPeersRoutine` reads peer information randomly from the address book, tries to dial the peer and requests from them information on other peers.

When a node receives information about other peers from a seed note, it sends another request to the node asking for more peers. 

A node also learns of other peers when they try to connect to it. 

### Dialing peers

Every node connects to a set of peers to whom it sends requests via the Switch. As described above, on startup the node dials peers providede to it by the node operator. Dialing the remaining peers is triggered by routines in the PEX reactor.

The PEX reactor ensures a node is connected to peers by running the `ensurePeers()`  which dials peers in the background until a threshold of connected peers is reached (`MaxNumOutboundPeers`). 

When a peer is accepted, it is not immediately dialed, but it's address will eventually be picked up by this routing. Peers to dial are chosen with some configurable bias for unvetted peers. 

The bias should be lower when we have fewer peers and can increase as we obtain more, ensuring that our first peers are more trustworthy, but always giving us the chance to discover new good peers. 

As the number of outgoing peers is limited, the reactor will choose the number of addresses to dial taking into account the current number of outgoing connections and ongoing dialings. The addresses to dial will be picked with a bias towards new and vetted peers (TODO define ).

Except for persistent peers, all other peers can be dialed at most `maxAttemptsToDial`. If a node is not connected by that time it is marked as bad. Otherwise, if the dial fails, the node will wait before the next dial. (exponential backoff mechanism). 

If a node needs more peers, the PEX reactor checks first whether peers marked as bad can be reinstated and then also picks a random peer from the store to dial. The PEX reactor relies on the switch to do the actual dialing of a peer.

Once the addresses to dial are known, they are forwarded to the `DialPeersAsync` routine of the switch. Each address is then dialed in parallel and the corresponding peer is added to the `dialing` list. 


#### *Successful dialing*

When a peer is successfully dialed, it is removed from the `dialing` list and added to the `peers` list. If the node has not reached a sufficient number of peers, it asks the newly connected peers for more peers. 

The switch then calls the `InitPeer` and `AddPeer` routines of all the reactors that have registered to it. 

#### *Dialing failed*


### *Removing peers*

Each reactor can call the `StopPeerForError` method of the switch with the ID of the peer that needs to be removed. Then the switch handles stopping the peer (closing the connection to it), and calls the `RemovePeer` method of all reactors registered to the switch.

## Peer ranking

In v0.34 there is no explicit ranking of peers. When choosing peers to dial, there is slight bias towards new and vetted peers. The amount of bias is higher when there are more peers connected to a node. 

In addition to this, peers  can be marked as bad and removed entirely from the potential candidate list. Reactors themselves can also mark peers as bad or good and thus influence the behaviour of the p2p layer. In v0.34 a peer is marked good only from the consensus reactor whenever a peer delivers a correct consensus message (TODO check conditiosn for this). 

A peer is marked as bad in the following cases: 
- It sends too frequent requests for peer information (`PexRequest` messages)
- Returns an error when a node requests peer information from it
- A node is not able to successfully dial a peer after `MaxDialAttempts` and the peer is not persistent (persistent peers are never marked as bad)

The PEX reactor checks periodically whether (TODO what is the exact condition) a peer can be reinstated and removed from the `bad peer` list. However, this is done only if a node does not have sufficient peers. Otehrwise, this list is never revisited. 

## Switch

Every Tendermint reactor regiters itself with the Switch by prividing a Channel ID it is listening to to it. The Switch then forwards messages destined to a particular channel. It is the reactors responisibility to process the messages. 

The switch is implemented as a service and, on start, listens for incoming connections in the background (calling the`acceptRoutine` function). 

Dialing peers, either via the PEX reactor or dialing persistent peers on startup, is done by calling the `DialPeersAsync` routine of the Switch.

When the connection to a peer is established (either by dialing it or accepting an incoming connection from it), the peer address is added to the address book. (The address book is managed by the PEX reactor). 

When a peer is added to the address book, it is marked as connected to and no further new connections are established between the node and this peer.  This is checked within `filterPeers` (called when adding a peer) and `IsDialingOrExistingAddress` (called when dialing a peer).

The number of peers a node can connect to is set by `MaxNumInboundPeers` and `MaxNumOutboundPeers` respectively. 

## Pex reactor

The PEX reactor is responsible for peer discovery and providing other peers with information about peers a node is already connected to. The PEX reactor receive routine listens to two types of messages: `PexRequest` and `PexAddress`. 

In case of `PexRequest` messages the reactor provides the requesting peer with known peer addresses (addresses stored in the address book). The reactor implements request rate limiting by counting the number of requests coming from a single peer. This operation can mark a peer good or bad for a certain amount of time. 

`PexAddress` messages are typically received after a successful request for addresses. Received addresses are added into the address book. Adding to the address book fails if:

- Node is tryign to add self
- The address is private 

A node has a requests map where it stores all requets it issued to a peer asking it for more peer addresses. If a `PexAddress` message returns an error, a node marks the sending peer as bad.

## Notes on diff v0.35+ and v0.34

*Diff 0.36* In v0.36.x there is no difference between the maximum number of inbound and outgoing peers. There is only one parameter to mark the maximum number of connections. But there is a weird tracking of connected peers. Peer is marked as connected by setting it as incoming or outgoing peer. This field has in practice no reference to accept to count incoming and outgoing connections.  

*Diff 0.35+* There is no connection upgrade. 

*Bug/suboptimal 0.36* Pex reactor, line 320. Not really random peer selection.   

*Unclear v0.36* p2p router l781: Why if error == nil do we output this

*Bug v0.36* p2p router l722 - this increment hgappens twice (once for in and once for out )

*v0.36 p2p statesync* If the statesyncing node has only two peers and one of those does not have the requested light block (has not created a snapshot yet for example), statesync will not look for additional peers but will fail to initialize the `StateProvider` and halt.
