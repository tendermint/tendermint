# Client and Server

This section is for those looking to implement their own ABCI Server, perhaps in
a new programming language.

You are expected to have read all previous sections of ABCI++ specification, namely
[Basic Concepts](./abci%2B%2B_basic_concepts.md),
[Methods](./abci%2B%2B_methods.md),
[Application Requirements](./abci%2B%2B_app_requirements.md), and
[Expected Behavior](./abci%2B%2B_tmint_expected_behavior.md).

## Message Protocol and Synchrony

The message protocol consists of pairs of requests and responses defined in the
[protobuf file](../../proto/tendermint/abci/types.proto).

Some messages have no fields, while others may include byte-arrays, strings, integers,
or custom protobuf types.

For more details on protobuf, see the [documentation](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview).

As of v0.36 requests are synchronous. For each of ABCI++'s four connections (see
[Connections](./abci%2B%2B_app_requirements.md)), when Tendermint issues a request to the
Application, it will wait for the response before continuing execution. As a side effect,
requests and responses are ordered for each connection, but not necessarily across connections.

## Server Implementations

To use ABCI in your programming language of choice, there must be an ABCI
server in that language. Tendermint supports four implementations of the ABCI server:

- in Tendermint's repository:
    - In-process
    - ABCI-socket
    - GRPC
- [tendermint-rs](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint-rs)
- [tower-abci](https://github.com/penumbra-zone/tower-abci)

The implementations in Tendermint's repository can be tested using `abci-cli` by setting
the `--abci` flag appropriately.

See examples, in various stages of maintenance, in
[Go](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/tree/master/abci/server),
[JavaScript](https://github.com/tendermint/js-abci),
[C++](https://github.com/mdyring/cpp-tmsp), and
[Java](https://github.com/jTendermint/jabci).

### In Process

The simplest implementation uses function calls in Golang.
This means ABCI applications written in Golang can be linked with Tendermint Core and run as a single binary.

### GRPC

If you are not using Golang,
but [GRPC](https://grpc.io/) is available in your language, this is the easiest approach,
though it will have significant performance overhead.

Please check GRPC's documentation to know to set up the Application as an
ABCI GRPC server.

### Socket

Tendermint's socket-based ABCI interface is an asynchronous,
raw socket server which provides ordered message passing over unix or tcp.
Messages are serialized using Protobuf3 and length-prefixed with a [signed Varint](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding?csw=1#signed-integers).

If GRPC is not available in your language, your application requires higher
performance, or otherwise enjoy programming, you may implement your own
ABCI server using the Tendermint's socket-based ABCI interface.
The first step is to auto-generate the relevant data
types and codec in your language using `protoc`.
In addition to being proto3 encoded, messages coming over
the socket are length-prefixed. proto3 doesn't have an
official length-prefix standard, so we use our own. The first byte in
the prefix represents the length of the Big Endian encoded length. The
remaining bytes in the prefix are the Big Endian encoded length.

For example, if the proto3 encoded ABCI message is `0xDEADBEEF` (4
bytes long), the length-prefixed message is `0x0104DEADBEEF` (`01` byte for encoding the length `04` of the message). If the proto3
encoded ABCI message is 65535 bytes long, the length-prefixed message
would start with 0x02FFFF.

Note that this length-prefixing scheme does not apply for GRPC.

Note that your ABCI server must be able to support multiple connections, as
Tendermint uses four connections.

## Client

There are currently two use-cases for an ABCI client. One is testing
tools that allow ABCI requests to be sent to the actual application via
command line. An example of this is `abci-cli`, which accepts CLI commands
to send corresponding ABCI requests.
The other is a consensus engine, such as Tendermint Core,
which makes ABCI requests to the application as prescribed by the consensus
algorithm used.
