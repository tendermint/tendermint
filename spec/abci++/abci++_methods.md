# Methods

## Methods existing in ABCI

### Echo

* **Request**:
    * `Message (string)`: A string to echo back
* **Response**:
    * `Message (string)`: The input string
* **Usage**:
    * Echo a string to test an abci client/server implementation

### Flush

* **Usage**:
    * Signals that messages queued on the client should be flushed to
    the server. It is called periodically by the client
    implementation to ensure asynchronous requests are actually
    sent, and is called immediately to make a synchronous request,
    which returns when the Flush response comes back.

### Info

* **Request**:

    | Name          | Type   | Description                              | Field Number |
    |---------------|--------|------------------------------------------|--------------|

    | Name                | Type   | Description                                         | Field Number |
    |---------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------|
    | data                | string | Some arbitrary information                          | 1            |
    | version             | string | The application software semantic version           | 2            |
    | app_version         | uint64 | The application protocol version                    | 3            |
    | last_block_height   | int64  | Latest height for which the app persisted its state | 4            |
    | last_block_app_hash | bytes  | Latest AppHash returned by `FinalizeBlock`          | 5            |

* **Usage**:
    * Return information about the application state.
    * Used to sync Tendermint with the application during a handshake
      that happens on startup or on recovery.
    * The returned `app_version` will be included in the Header of every block.
    * Tendermint expects `last_block_app_hash` and `last_block_height` to
      be updated during `FinalizeBlock` and persisted during `Commit`.

### InitChain

* **Request**:

    | Name             | Type                                            | Description                                         | Field Number |
    |------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------|
    | time             | [google.protobuf.Timestamp][protobuf-timestamp] | Genesis time                                        | 1            |
    | chain_id         | string                                          | ID of the blockchain.                               | 2            |
    | consensus_params | [ConsensusParams](#consensusparams)             | Initial consensus-critical parameters.              | 3            |
    | validators       | repeated [ValidatorUpdate](#validatorupdate)    | Initial genesis validators, sorted by voting power. | 4            |
    | app_state_bytes  | bytes                                           | Serialized initial application state. JSON bytes.   | 5            |
    | initial_height   | int64                                           | Height of the initial block (typically `1`).        | 6            |

* **Response**:

    | Name             | Type                                         | Description                                      | Field Number |
    |------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------|
    | consensus_params | [ConsensusParams](#consensusparams)          | Initial consensus-critical parameters (optional) | 1            |
    | validators       | repeated [ValidatorUpdate](#validatorupdate) | Initial validator set (optional).                | 2            |
    | app_hash         | bytes                                        | Initial application hash.                        | 3            |

* **Usage**:
    * Called once upon genesis.
    * If `ResponseInitChain.Validators` is empty, the initial validator set will be the `RequestInitChain.Validators`
    * If `ResponseInitChain.Validators` is not empty, it will be the initial
      validator set (regardless of what is in `RequestInitChain.Validators`).
    * This allows the app to decide if it wants to accept the initial validator
      set proposed by Tendermint (ie. in the genesis file), or if it wants to use
      a different one (perhaps computed based on some application specific
      information in the genesis file).
    * Both `RequestInitChain.Validators` and `ResponseInitChain.Validators` are [ValidatorUpdate](#validatorupdate) structs.
      So, technically, they both are _updating_ the set of validators from the empty set.

### Query

* **Request**:

    | Name   | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Field Number |

* **Response**:

    | Name       | Type                                                        | Description                                                           | Field Number |
    |------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
    | code       | uint32                                                      | Response code.                                                        | 1            |

    | gas_wanted | int64                                                       | Amount of gas requested for transaction.                              | 5            |
    | codespace  | string                                                      | Namespace for the `code`.                                             | 8            |
    | sender     | string                                                      | The transaction's sender (e.g. the signer)                            | 9            |

* **Usage**:

    * Technically optional - not involved in processing blocks.
    * Guardian of the mempool: every node runs `CheckTx` before letting a
      transaction into its local mempool.
    * The transaction may come from an external user or another node
    * `CheckTx` validates the transaction against the current state of the application,
      for example, checking signatures and account balances, but does not apply any
      of the state changes described in the transaction.
    * Transactions where `ResponseCheckTx.Code != 0` will be rejected - they will not be broadcast
      to other nodes or included in a proposal block.
      Tendermint attributes no other value to the response code.

### Commit

#### Parameters and Types

* **Request**:

    | Name   | Type  | Description | Field Number |
    |--------|-------|-------------|--------------|

    Commit signals the application to persist application state. It takes no parameters.

* **Response**:

    | Name          | Type  | Description                                                            | Field Number |
    |---------------|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
    | retain_height | int64 | Blocks below this height may be removed. Defaults to `0` (retain all). | 3            |

* **Usage**:

    * Signal the Application to persist the application state.
      Application is expected to persist its state at the end of this call, before calling `ResponseCommit`.
    * Use `ResponseCommit.retain_height` with caution! If all nodes in the network remove historical
      blocks then this data is permanently lost, and no new nodes will be able to join the network and
      bootstrap. Historical blocks may also be required for other purposes, e.g. auditing, replay of
      non-persisted heights, light client verification, and so on.

### ListSnapshots

* **Response**:

    | Name      | Type                           | Description                    | Field Number |
    |-----------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------|
    | snapshots | repeated [Snapshot](#snapshot) | List of local state snapshots. | 1            |

    | Name   | Type   | Description                                                           | Field Number |
    |--------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
    | height | uint64 | The height of the snapshot the chunk belongs to.                      | 1            |
    | format | uint32 | The application-specific format of the snapshot the chunk belongs to. | 2            |
    | chunk  | uint32 | The chunk index, starting from `0` for the initial chunk.             | 3            |

* **Response**:

    | Name  | Type  | Description                                                                                                                                           | Field Number |
    |-------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
    | chunk | bytes | The binary chunk contents, in an arbitray format. Chunk messages cannot be larger than 16 MB _including metadata_, so 10 MB is a good starting point. | 1            |

* **Usage**:
    * Used during state sync to retrieve snapshot chunks from peers.

### OfferSnapshot

* **Request**:

    | Name     | Type                  | Description                                                              | Field Number |
    |----------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
    | snapshot | [Snapshot](#snapshot) | The snapshot offered for restoration.                                    | 1            |
    | app_hash | bytes                 | The light client-verified app hash for this height, from the blockchain. | 2            |

* **Response**:

    | Name   | Type              | Description                       | Field Number |
    |--------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|
    | result | [Result](#result) | The result of the snapshot offer. | 1            |

#### Result

```protobuf
  enum Result {
    UNKNOWN       = 0;  // Unknown result, abort all snapshot restoration
    ACCEPT        = 1;  // Snapshot is accepted, start applying chunks.
    ABORT         = 2;  // Abort snapshot restoration, and don't try any other snapshots.
    REJECT        = 3;  // Reject this specific snapshot, try others.
    REJECT_FORMAT = 4;  // Reject all snapshots with this `format`, try others.
    REJECT_SENDER = 5;  // Reject all snapshots from all senders of this snapshot, try others.
  }
```

* **Usage**:
    * `OfferSnapshot` is called when bootstrapping a node using state sync. The application may
    accept or reject snapshots as appropriate. Upon accepting, Tendermint will retrieve and
    apply snapshot chunks via `ApplySnapshotChunk`. The application may also choose to reject a
    snapshot in the chunk response, in which case it should be prepared to accept further
    `OfferSnapshot` calls.
    * Only `AppHash` can be trusted, as it has been verified by the light client. Any other data
    can be spoofed by adversaries, so applications should employ additional verification schemes
    to avoid denial-of-service attacks. The verified `AppHash` is automatically checked against
    the restored application at the end of snapshot restoration.
    * For more information, see the `Snapshot` data type or the [state sync section](../p2p/messages/state-sync.md).

    |----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
    | result         | Result  (see below) | The result of applying this chunk.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 1            |
    | refetch_chunks | repeated uint32     | Refetch and reapply the given chunks, regardless of `result`. Only the listed chunks will be refetched, and reapplied in sequential order.                                                                                              | 2            |
    | reject_senders | repeated string     | Reject the given P2P senders, regardless of `Result`. Any chunks already applied will not be refetched unless explicitly requested, but queued chunks from these senders will be discarded, and new chunks or other snapshots rejected. | 3            |

```proto
  enum Result {
    UNKNOWN         = 0;  // Unknown result, abort all snapshot restoration
    ACCEPT          = 1;  // The chunk was accepted.
    ABORT           = 2;  // Abort snapshot restoration, and don't try any other snapshots.
    RETRY           = 3;  // Reapply this chunk, combine with `RefetchChunks` and `RejectSenders` as appropriate.
    RETRY_SNAPSHOT  = 4;  // Restart this snapshot from `OfferSnapshot`, reusing chunks unless instructed otherwise.
    REJECT_SNAPSHOT = 5;  // Reject this snapshot, try a different one.
  }
```

* **Usage**:
    * The application can choose to refetch chunks and/or ban P2P peers as appropriate. Tendermint
    will not do this unless instructed by the application.
    * The application may want to verify each chunk, e.g. by attaching chunk hashes in
    `Snapshot.Metadata` and/or incrementally verifying contents against `AppHash`.
    * When all chunks have been accepted, Tendermint will make an ABCI `Info` call to verify that
    `LastBlockAppHash` and `LastBlockHeight` matches the expected values, and record the
    `AppVersion` in the node state. It then switches to block sync or consensus and joins the
    network.
    * If Tendermint is unable to retrieve the next chunk after some time (e.g. because no suitable
    peers are available), it will reject the snapshot and try a different one via `OfferSnapshot`.
    The application should be prepared to reset and accept it or abort as appropriate.

* **Usage**:
    * `RequestPrepareProposal`'s parameters `txs`, `misbehavior`, `height`, `time`,
      `next_validators_hash`, and `proposer_address` are the same as in `RequestProcessProposal`
      and `RequestFinalizeBlock`.
    * `RequestPrepareProposal.local_last_commit` is a set of the precommit votes that allowed the
      decision of the previous block, together with their corresponding vote extensions.
    * The `height`, `time`, and `proposer_address` values match the values from the header of the
      proposed block.
    * `RequestPrepareProposal` contains a preliminary set of transactions `txs` that Tendermint
      retrieved from the mempool, called _raw proposal_. The Application can modify this
      set via `ResponsePrepareProposal.tx_records` (see [TxRecord](#txrecord)).
        * The Application _can_ modify the raw proposal: it can reorder, remove or add transactions.
          Let `tx` be a transaction in `txs`:
            * If the Application considers that `tx` should not be proposed in this block, e.g.,
              there are other transactions with higher priority, then it should not include it in
              `tx_records`. In this case, Tendermint will not remove `tx` from the mempool. The
              Application should be extra-careful, as abusing this feature may cause transactions
              to stay much longer than needed in the mempool.
            * If the Application considers that `tx` should not be included in the proposal and
              removed from the mempool, then the Application should include it in `tx_records` and
              _mark_ it as `REMOVED`. In this case, Tendermint will remove `tx` from the mempool.
            * If the Application wants to add a new transaction to the proposed block, then the
              Application includes it in `tx_records` and _marks_ it as `ADDED`. In this case, Tendermint
              will also add the transaction to the mempool.
        * The Application should be aware that removing and adding transactions may compromise
          _traceability_.
          > Consider the following example: the Application transforms a client-submitted
            transaction `t1` into a second transaction `t2`, i.e., the Application asks Tendermint
            to remove `t1` and add `t2` to the mempool. If a client wants to eventually check what
            happened to `t1`, it will discover that `t1` is neither in the mempool nor in a
            committed block, getting the wrong idea that `t1` did not make it into a block. Note
            that `t2` _will be_ in a committed block, but unless the Application tracks this
            information, no component will be aware of it. Thus, if the Application wants
            traceability, it is its responsability to support it. For instance, the Application
            could attach to a transformed transaction a list with the hashes of the transactions it
            derives from.
    * Tendermint MAY include a list of transactions in `RequestPrepareProposal.txs` whose total
      size in bytes exceeds `RequestPrepareProposal.max_tx_bytes`.
      Therefore, if the size of `RequestPrepareProposal.txs` is greater than
      `RequestPrepareProposal.max_tx_bytes`, the Application MUST remove transactions to ensure
      that the `RequestPrepareProposal.max_tx_bytes` limit is respected by those transaction
      records returned in `ResponsePrepareProposal.tx_records` that are marked as `UNMODIFIED` or
      `ADDED`.
    * In same-block execution mode, the Application must provide values for
      `ResponsePrepareProposal.app_hash`, `ResponsePrepareProposal.tx_results`,
      `ResponsePrepareProposal.validator_updates`, and
      `ResponsePrepareProposal.consensus_param_updates`, as a result of fully executing the block.
        * The values for `ResponsePrepareProposal.validator_updates`, or
          `ResponsePrepareProposal.consensus_param_updates` may be empty. In this case, Tendermint will keep
          the current values.
        * `ResponsePrepareProposal.validator_updates`, triggered by block `H`, affect validation
          for blocks `H+1`, and `H+2`. Heights following a validator update are affected in the following way:
            * Height `H`: `NextValidatorsHash` includes the new `validator_updates` value.
            * Height `H+1`: The validator set change takes effect and `ValidatorsHash` is updated.
            * Height `H+2`: `*_last_commit` fields in `PrepareProposal`, `ProcessProposal`, and
              `FinalizeBlock` now include the altered validator set.
        * `ResponseFinalizeBlock.consensus_param_updates` returned for block `H` apply to the consensus
          params for block `H+1` even if the change is agreed in block `H`.
          For more information on the consensus parameters,
          see the [consensus parameters](./abci%2B%2B_app_requirements.md#consensus-parameters)
          section.
        * It is the Application's responsibility to set the right value for _TimeoutPropose_ so that
          the (synchronous) execution of the block does not cause other processes to prevote `nil` because
          their propose timeout goes off.
    * In next-block execution mode, Tendermint will ignore parameters
      `ResponsePrepareProposal.app_hash`, `ResponsePrepareProposal.tx_results`,
      `ResponsePrepareProposal.validator_updates`, and `ResponsePrepareProposal.consensus_param_updates`.
    * As a result of executing the prepared proposal, the Application may produce block events or transaction events.
      The Application must keep those events until a block is decided and then pass them on to Tendermint via
      `ResponseFinalizeBlock`.
    * Likewise, in next-block execution mode, the Application must keep all responses to executing
      transactions until it can call `ResponseFinalizeBlock`.
    * As a sanity check, Tendermint will check the returned parameters for validity if the Application modified them.
      In particular, `ResponsePrepareProposal.tx_records` will be deemed invalid if
        * There is a duplicate transaction in the list.
        * A new transaction is marked as `UNMODIFIED` or `REMOVED`.
        * An existing transaction is marked as `ADDED`.
        * A transaction is marked as `UNKNOWN`.
    * If Tendermint fails to validate the `ResponsePrepareProposal`, Tendermint will assume the
      Application is faulty and crash.
    * The implementation of `PrepareProposal` can be non-deterministic.

#### When does Tendermint call `PrepareProposal`?

When a validator _p_ enters Tendermint consensus round _r_, height _h_, in which _p_ is the proposer,
and _p_'s _validValue_ is `nil`:

1. Tendermint collects outstanding transactions from _p_'s mempool
    * the transactions will be collected in order of priority
    * _p_'s Tendermint creates a block header.
2. _p_'s Tendermint calls `RequestPrepareProposal` with the newly generated block, the local
   commit of the previous height (with vote extensions), and any outstanding evidence of
   misbehavior. The call is synchronous: Tendermint's execution will block until the Application
   returns from the call.
3. The Application uses the information received (transactions, commit info, misbehavior, time) to
    (potentially) modify the proposal.
    * in same-block execution mode, the Application fully executes the block and provides values
      for `ResponsePrepareProposal.app_hash`, `ResponsePrepareProposal.tx_results`,
      `ResponsePrepareProposal.validator_updates`, and
      `ResponsePrepareProposal.consensus_param_updates`.
    * in next-block execution mode, _p_'s Tendermint will ignore the values for
      `ResponsePrepareProposal.app_hash`, `ResponsePrepareProposal.tx_results`,
      `ResponsePrepareProposal.validator_updates`, and
      `ResponsePrepareProposal.consensus_param_updates`.
    * in both modes, the Application can manipulate transactions:
        * leave transactions untouched - `TxAction = UNMODIFIED`
        * add new transactions (not present initially) to the proposal - `TxAction = ADDED`
        * remove (invalid) transactions from the proposal and from the mempool - `TxAction = REMOVED`
        * remove transactions from the proposal but not from the mempool (effectively _delaying_ them) - the
          Application does not include the transaction in `ResponsePrepareProposal.tx_records`
        * modify transactions (e.g. aggregate them) - `TxAction = ADDED` followed by
          `TxAction = REMOVED`. As explained above, this compromises client traceability, unless
          it is implemented at the Application level.
        * reorder transactions - the Application reorders transactions in the list
4. The Application includes the transaction list (whether modified or not) in the return parameters
   (see the rules in section _Usage_), and returns from the call.
5. _p_'s Tendermint uses the (possibly) modified block as _p_'s proposal in round _r_, height _h_.

Note that, if _p_ has a non-`nil` _validValue_ in round _r_, height _h_, Tendermint will use it as
proposal and will not call `RequestPrepareProposal`.

    | consensus_param_updates | [ConsensusParams](#consensusparams)              | Changes to gas, size, and other consensus-related parameters.                     | 5            |

* **Usage**:
    * Contains all information on the proposed block needed to fully execute it.
        * The Application may fully execute the block as though it was handling
         `RequestFinalizeBlock`.
        * However, any resulting state changes must be kept as _candidate state_,
          and the Application should be ready to discard it in case another block is decided.
    * `RequestProcessProposal` is also called at the proposer of a round. The reason for this is to
      inform the Application of the block header's hash, which cannot be done at `PrepareProposal`
      time. In this case, the call to `RequestProcessProposal` occurs right after the call to
      `RequestPrepareProposal`.
    * The height and time values match the values from the header of the proposed block.
    * If `ResponseProcessProposal.status` is `REJECT`, Tendermint assumes the proposal received
      is not valid.
    * In same-block execution mode, the Application is required to fully execute the block and provide values
      for parameters `ResponseProcessProposal.app_hash`, `ResponseProcessProposal.tx_results`,
      `ResponseProcessProposal.validator_updates`, and `ResponseProcessProposal.consensus_param_updates`,
      so that Tendermint can then verify the hashes in the block's header are correct.
      If the hashes mismatch, Tendermint will reject the block even if `ResponseProcessProposal.status`
      was set to `ACCEPT`.
    * In next-block execution mode, the Application should _not_ provide values for parameters
      `ResponseProcessProposal.app_hash`, `ResponseProcessProposal.tx_results`,
      `ResponseProcessProposal.validator_updates`, and `ResponseProcessProposal.consensus_param_updates`.
    * The implementation of `ProcessProposal` MUST be deterministic. Moreover, the value of
      `ResponseProcessProposal.status` MUST **exclusively** depend on the parameters passed in
      the call to `RequestProcessProposal`, and the last committed Application state
      (see [Requirements](./abci++_app_requirements.md) section).
    * Moreover, application implementors SHOULD always set `ResponseProcessProposal.status` to `ACCEPT`,
      unless they _really_ know what the potential liveness implications of returning `REJECT` are.

#### When does Tendermint call `ProcessProposal`?

When a validator _p_ enters Tendermint consensus round _r_, height _h_, in which _q_ is the proposer (possibly _p_ = _q_):

1. _p_ sets up timer `ProposeTimeout`.
2. If _p_ is the proposer, _p_ executes steps 1-6 in [PrepareProposal](#prepareproposal).
3. Upon reception of Proposal message (which contains the header) for round _r_, height _h_ from
   _q_, _p_'s Tendermint verifies the block header.
4. Upon reception of Proposal message, along with all the block parts, for round _r_, height _h_
   from _q_, _p_'s Tendermint follows its algorithm to check whether it should prevote for the
   proposed block, or `nil`.
5. If Tendermint should prevote for the proposed block:
    1. Tendermint calls `RequestProcessProposal` with the block. The call is synchronous.
    2. The Application checks/processes the proposed block, which is read-only, and returns
       `ACCEPT` or `REJECT` in the `ResponseProcessProposal.status` field.
       * The Application, depending on its needs, may call `ResponseProcessProposal`
         * either after it has completely processed the block (immediate execution),
         * or after doing some basic checks, and process the block asynchronously. In this case the
           Application will not be able to reject the block, or force prevote/precommit `nil`
           afterwards.
    3. If the returned value is
         * `ACCEPT`: Tendermint prevotes on this proposal for round _r_, height _h_.
         * `REJECT`: Tendermint prevotes `nil`.

### ExtendVote

#### Parameters and Types

* **Request**:

    | Name   | Type  | Description                                                                   | Field Number |
    |--------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
    | hash   | bytes | The header hash of the proposed block that the vote extension is to refer to. | 1            |
    | height | int64 | Height of the proposed block (for sanity check).                              | 2            |

* **Response**:

    | Name              | Type  | Description                                             | Field Number |
    |-------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
    | vote_extension    | bytes | Information signed by by Tendermint. Can have 0 length. | 1            |

* **Usage**:
    * `ResponseExtendVote.vote_extension` is application-generated information that will be signed
      by Tendermint and attached to the Precommit message.
    * The Application may choose to use an empty vote extension (0 length).
    * `RequestExtendVote.hash` corresponds to the hash of a proposed block that was made available
      to the Application in a previous call to `ProcessProposal` for the current height.
    * `ResponseExtendVote.vote_extension` will only be attached to a non-`nil` Precommit message. If Tendermint is to
      precommit `nil`, it will not call `RequestExtendVote`.
    * The Application logic that creates the extension can be non-deterministic.

#### When does Tendermint call `ExtendVote`?

When a validator _p_ is in Tendermint consensus state _prevote_ of round _r_, height _h_, in which _q_ is the proposer; and _p_ has received

* the Proposal message _v_ for round _r_, height _h_, along with all the block parts, from _q_,
* `Prevote` messages from _2f + 1_ validators' voting power for round _r_, height _h_, prevoting for the same block _id(v)_,

then _p_'s Tendermint locks _v_  and sends a Precommit message in the following way

1. _p_'s Tendermint sets _lockedValue_ and _validValue_ to _v_, and sets _lockedRound_ and _validRound_ to _r_
2. _p_'s Tendermint calls `RequestExtendVote` with _id(v)_ (`RequestExtendVote.hash`). The call is synchronous.
3. The Application returns an array of bytes, `ResponseExtendVote.extension`, which is not interpreted by Tendermint.
4. _p_'s Tendermint includes `ResponseExtendVote.extension` in a field of type [CanonicalVoteExtension](#canonicalvoteextension),
   it then populates the other fields in [CanonicalVoteExtension](#canonicalvoteextension), and signs the populated
   data structure.
5. _p_'s Tendermint constructs and signs the [CanonicalVote](../core/data_structures.md#canonicalvote) structure.
6. _p_'s Tendermint constructs the Precommit message (i.e. [Vote](../core/data_structures.md#vote) structure)
   using [CanonicalVoteExtension](#canonicalvoteextension) and [CanonicalVote](../core/data_structures.md#canonicalvote).
7. _p_'s Tendermint broadcasts the Precommit message.

In the cases when _p_'s Tendermint is to broadcast `precommit nil` messages (either _2f+1_ `prevote nil` messages received,
or _timeoutPrevote_ triggered), _p_'s Tendermint does **not** call `RequestExtendVote` and will not include
a [CanonicalVoteExtension](#canonicalvoteextension) field in the `precommit nil` message.

### VerifyVoteExtension

#### Parameters and Types

* **Request**:

    | Name              | Type  | Description                                                                               | Field Number |
    |-------------------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
    | hash              | bytes | The hash of the proposed block that the vote extension refers to.                         | 1            |
    | validator_address | bytes | [Address](../core/data_structures.md#address) of the validator that signed the extension. | 2            |
    | height            | int64 | Height of the block (for sanity check).                                                   | 3            |
    | vote_extension    | bytes | Application-specific information signed by Tendermint. Can have 0 length.                 | 4            |

* **Response**:

    | Name   | Type                          | Description                                                    | Field Number |
    |--------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
    | status | [VerifyStatus](#verifystatus) | `enum` signaling if the application accepts the vote extension | 1            |

* **Usage**:
    * `RequestVerifyVoteExtension.vote_extension` can be an empty byte array. The Application's
      interpretation of it should be
      that the Application running at the process that sent the vote chose not to extend it.
      Tendermint will always call `RequestVerifyVoteExtension`, even for 0 length vote extensions.
    * `RequestVerifyVoteExtension` is not called for precommit votes sent by the local process.
    * `RequestVerifyVoteExtension.hash` refers to a proposed block. There is not guarantee that
      this proposed block has previously been exposed to the Application via `ProcessProposal`.
    * If `ResponseVerifyVoteExtension.status` is `REJECT`, Tendermint will reject the whole received vote.
      See the [Requirements](./abci++_app_requirements.md) section to understand the potential
      liveness implications of this.
    * The implementation of `VerifyVoteExtension` MUST be deterministic. Moreover, the value of
      `ResponseVerifyVoteExtension.status` MUST **exclusively** depend on the parameters passed in
      the call to `RequestVerifyVoteExtension`, and the last committed Application state
      (see [Requirements](./abci++_app_requirements.md) section).
    * Moreover, application implementers SHOULD always set `ResponseVerifyVoteExtension.status` to `ACCEPT`,
      unless they _really_ know what the potential liveness implications of returning `REJECT` are.

#### When does Tendermint call `VerifyVoteExtension`?

When a node _p_ is in Tendermint consensus round _r_, height _h_, and _p_ receives a Precommit
message for round _r_, height _h_ from validator _q_ (_q_ &ne; _p_):

1. If the Precommit message does not contain a vote extension with a valid signature, Tendermint
   discards the Precommit message as invalid.
   * a 0-length vote extension is valid as long as its accompanying signature is also valid.
2. Else, _p_'s Tendermint calls `RequestVerifyVoteExtension`.
3. The Application returns `ACCEPT` or `REJECT` via `ResponseVerifyVoteExtension.status`.
4. If the Application returns
   * `ACCEPT`, _p_'s Tendermint will keep the received vote, together with its corresponding
     vote extension in its internal data structures. It will be used to populate the [ExtendedCommitInfo](#extendedcommitinfo)
     structure in calls to `RequestPrepareProposal`, in rounds of height _h + 1_ where _p_ is the proposer.
   * `REJECT`, _p_'s Tendermint will deem the Precommit message invalid and discard it.

* **Usage**:
    * Contains the fields of the newly decided block.
    * This method is equivalent to the call sequence `BeginBlock`, [`DeliverTx`],
      and `EndBlock` in the previous version of ABCI.
    * The height and time values match the values from the header of the proposed block.
    * The Application can use `RequestFinalizeBlock.decided_last_commit` and `RequestFinalizeBlock.misbehavior`
      to determine rewards and punishments for the validators.
    * The Application executes the transactions in `RequestFinalizeBlock.txs` deterministically,
      according to the rules set up by the Application, before returning control to Tendermint.
      Alternatively, it can apply the candidate state corresponding to the same block previously
      executed via `PrepareProposal` or `ProcessProposal`.
    * `ResponseFinalizeBlock.tx_results[i].Code == 0` only if the _i_-th transaction is fully valid.
    * In next-block execution mode, the Application must provide values for `ResponseFinalizeBlock.app_hash`,
      `ResponseFinalizeBlock.tx_results`, `ResponseFinalizeBlock.validator_updates`, and
      `ResponseFinalizeBlock.consensus_param_updates` as a result of executing the block.
        * The values for `ResponseFinalizeBlock.validator_updates`, or
          `ResponseFinalizeBlock.consensus_param_updates` may be empty. In this case, Tendermint will keep
          the current values.
        * `ResponseFinalizeBlock.validator_updates`, triggered by block `H`, affect validation
          for blocks `H+1`, `H+2`, and `H+3`. Heights following a validator update are affected in the following way:
            * Height `H+1`: `NextValidatorsHash` includes the new `validator_updates` value.
            * Height `H+2`: The validator set change takes effect and `ValidatorsHash` is updated.
            * Height `H+3`: `*_last_commit` fields in `PrepareProposal`, `ProcessProposal`, and
              `FinalizeBlock` now include the altered validator set.
        * `ResponseFinalizeBlock.consensus_param_updates` returned for block `H` apply to the consensus
          params for block `H+1`. For more information on the consensus parameters,
          see the [consensus parameters](./abci%2B%2B_app_requirements.md#consensus-parameters)
          section.

    * In same-block execution mode, Tendermint will log an error and ignore values for
      `ResponseFinalizeBlock.app_hash`, `ResponseFinalizeBlock.tx_results`, `ResponseFinalizeBlock.validator_updates`,
      and `ResponsePrepareProposal.consensus_param_updates`, as those must have been provided by `PrepareProposal`.
    * `ResponseFinalizeBlock.app_hash` contains an (optional) Merkle root hash of the application state.
    * `ResponseFinalizeBlock.app_hash` is included
        * [in next-block execution mode] as the `Header.AppHash` in the next block.
        * [in same-block execution mode] as the `Header.AppHash` in the current block. In this case,
          `PrepareProposal` is required to fully execute the block and set the App hash before
          returning the proposed block to Tendermint.
        * `ResponseFinalizeBlock.app_hash` may also be empty or hard-coded, but MUST be
          **deterministic** - it must not be a function of anything that did not come from the parameters
          of `RequestFinalizeBlock` and the previous committed state.
    * Later calls to `Query` can return proofs about the application state anchored
      in this Merkle root hash.
    * The implementation of `FinalizeBlock` MUST be deterministic, since it is
      making the Application's state evolve in the context of state machine replication.
    * Currently, Tendermint will fill up all fields in `RequestFinalizeBlock`, even if they were
      already passed on to the Application via `RequestPrepareProposal` or `RequestProcessProposal`.
      If the Application is in same-block execution mode, it applies the right candidate state here
      (rather than executing the whole block). In this case the Application disregards all parameters in
      `RequestFinalizeBlock` except `RequestFinalizeBlock.hash`.

#### When does Tendermint call `FinalizeBlock`?

When a node _p_ is in Tendermint consensus height _h_, and _p_ receives

* the Proposal message with block _v_ for a round _r_, along with all its block parts, from _q_,
  which is the proposer of round _r_, height _h_,
* `Precommit` messages from _2f + 1_ validators' voting power for round _r_, height _h_,
  precommitting the same block _id(v)_,

then _p_'s Tendermint decides block _v_ and finalizes consensus for height _h_ in the following way

1. _p_'s Tendermint persists _v_ as the decision for height _h_.
2. _p_'s Tendermint calls `RequestFinalizeBlock` with _v_'s data. The call is synchronous.
3. _p_'s Application executes block _v_.
4. _p_'s Application calculates and returns the _AppHash_, along with a list containing
   the outputs of each of the transactions executed.
5. _p_'s Tendermint hashes all the transaction outputs and stores it in _ResultHash_.
6. _p_'s Tendermint persists the transaction outputs, _AppHash_, and _ResultsHash_.
7. _p_'s Tendermint locks the mempool &mdash; no calls to `CheckTx` on new transactions.
8. _p_'s Tendermint calls `RequestCommit` to instruct the Application to persist its state.
9. _p_'s Tendermint, optionally, re-checks all outstanding transactions in the mempool
   against the newly persisted Application state.
10. _p_'s Tendermint unlocks the mempool &mdash; newly received transactions can now be checked.
11. _p_'s starts consensus for height _h+1_, round 0

### TxAction

```proto
enum TxAction {
  UNKNOWN    = 0;  // Unknown action
  UNMODIFIED = 1;  // The Application did not modify this transaction.
  ADDED      = 2;  // The Application added this transaction.
  REMOVED    = 3;  // The Application wants this transaction removed from the proposal and the mempool.
}
```

* **Usage**:
    * If `Action` is `UNKNOWN`, a problem happened in the Application. Tendermint will assume the application is faulty and crash.
    * If `Action` is `UNMODIFIED`, Tendermint includes the transaction in the proposal. Nothing to do on the mempool.
    * If `Action` is `ADDED`, Tendermint includes the transaction in the proposal. The transaction is _not_ added to the mempool.
    * If `Action` is `REMOVED`, Tendermint excludes the transaction from the proposal. The transaction is also removed from the mempool if it exists,
      similar to `CheckTx` returning an error code.

### TxRecord

* **Fields**:

    | Name       | Type                  | Description                                                      | Field Number |

### ProposalStatus

```proto
enum ProposalStatus {
  UNKNOWN = 0; // Unknown status. Returning this from the application is always an error. 
  ACCEPT  = 1; // Status that signals that the application finds the proposal valid.
  REJECT  = 2; // Status that signals that the application finds the proposal invalid.
}
```

* **Usage**:
    * Used within the [ProcessProposal](#processproposal) response.
        * If `Status` is `UNKNOWN`, a problem happened in the Application. Tendermint will assume the application is faulty and crash.
        * If `Status` is `ACCEPT`, Tendermint accepts the proposal and will issue a Prevote message for it.
        * If `Status` is `REJECT`, Tendermint rejects the proposal and will issue a Prevote for `nil` instead.

### VerifyStatus

```proto
enum VerifyStatus {
  UNKNOWN = 0; // Unknown status. Returning this from the application is always an error.
  ACCEPT  = 1; // Status that signals that the application finds the vote extension valid.
  REJECT  = 2; // Status that signals that the application finds the vote extension invalid.
}
```

* **Usage**:
    * Used within the [VerifyVoteExtension](#verifyvoteextension) response.
        * If `Status` is `UNKNOWN`, a problem happened in the Application. Tendermint will assume the application is faulty and crash.
        * If `Status` is `ACCEPT`, Tendermint will accept the vote as valid.
        * If `Status` is `REJECT`, Tendermint will reject the vote as invalid.


### CanonicalVoteExtension

>**TODO**: This protobuf message definition is not part of the ABCI++ interface, but rather belongs to the
> Precommit message which is broadcast via P2P. So it is to be moved to the relevant section of the spec.

* **Fields**:

    | Name      | Type   | Description                                                                                | Field Number |

    | height    | int64  | Height in which the extension was provided.                                                | 2            |
    | round     | int32  | Round in which the extension was provided.                                                 | 3            |
    | chain_id  | string | ID of the blockchain running consensus.                                                    | 4            |
    | address   | bytes  | [Address](../core/data_structures.md#address) of the validator that provided the extension | 5            |

* **Usage**:
    * Tendermint is to sign the whole data structure and attach it to a Precommit message
    * Upon reception, Tendermint validates the sender's signature and sanity-checks the values of `height`, `round`, and `chain_id`.
      Then it sends `extension` to the Application via `RequestVerifyVoteExtension` for verification.
