\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

We have proposed a new Byzantine-fault tolerant consensus algorithm that is the
core of the Tendermint BFT SMR platform. The algorithm is designed for the wide
area network with high number of mutually distrusted nodes that communicate
over gossip based peer-to-peer network. It has only a single mode of execution
and the communication pattern is very similar to the "normal" case of the
state-of-the art PBFT algorithm. The algorithm ensures termination with a novel
mechanism that takes advantage of the gossip based communication between nodes.
The proposed algorithm and the proofs are simple and elegant, and we believe
that this makes it easier to understand and implement correctly.
