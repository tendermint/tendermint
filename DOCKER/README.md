## Tendermint

Tendermint Core is Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) middleware that takes a state transition machine, written in any programming language, and securely replicates it on many machines.

For more background, see the [the docs](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/introduction/#quick-start).

To get started developing applications, see the [application developers guide](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/introduction/quick-start.html).

## How to use this image

### Start one instance of the Tendermint core with the `kvstore` app

A quick example of a built-in app and Tendermint core in one container.

```sh
docker run -it --rm -v "/tmp:/tendermint" tendermint/tendermint init
docker run -it --rm -v "/tmp:/tendermint" tendermint/tendermint start --proxy-app=kvstore
```

## Local cluster

To run a 4-node network, see the `Makefile` in the root of [the repo](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/master/Makefile) and run:

```sh
make build-linux
make build-docker-localnode
make localnet-start
```

Note that this will build and use a different image than the ones provided here.
