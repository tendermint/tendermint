// detectDivergence is a second wall of defense for the light client.
//
// It takes the target verified header and compares it with the headers of a set of
// witness providers that the light client is connected to. If a conflicting header
// is returned it verifies and examines the conflicting header against the verified
// trace that was produced from the primary. If successful, it produces two sets of evidence
// and sends them to the opposite provider before halting.
//
// If there are no conflictinge headers, the light client deems the verified target header
// trusted and saves it to the trusted store.
