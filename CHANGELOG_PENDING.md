### FEATURES

- [rpc] [\#7270](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/7270) Add `header` and `header_by_hash` RPC Client queries. (@fedekunze)
- [rpc] [\#7701] Add `ApplicationInfo` to `status` rpc call which contains the application version. (@jonasbostoen)
- [cli] [#7033](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/7033) Add a `rollback` command to rollback to the previous tendermint state in the event of non-determinstic app hash or reverting an upgrade.
- [mempool, rpc] \#7041  Add removeTx operation to the RPC layer. (@tychoish)
- [consensus] \#7354 add a new `synchrony` field to the `ConsensusParameter` struct for controlling the parameters of the proposer-based timestamp algorithm. (@williambanfield)
- [consensus] \#7376 Update the proposal logic per the Propose-based timestamps specification so that the proposer will wait for the previous block time to occur before proposing the next block. (@williambanfield)
- [consensus] \#7391 Use the proposed block timestamp as the proposal timestamp. Update the block validation logic to ensure that the proposed block's timestamp matches the timestamp in the proposal message. (@williambanfield)
- [consensus] \#7415 Update proposal validation logic to Prevote nil if a proposal does not meet the conditions for Timelyness per the proposer-based timestamp specification. (@anca)
- [consensus] \#7382 Update block validation to no longer require the block timestamp to be the median of the timestamps of the previous commit. (@anca)
- [consensus] \#7711 Use the proposer timestamp for the first height instead of the genesis time. Chains will still start consensus at the genesis time. (@anca)

### IMPROVEMENTS

- [internal/protoio] \#7325 Optimized `MarshalDelimited` by inlining the common case and using a `sync.Pool` in the worst case. (@odeke-em)
- [consensus] \#6969 remove logic to 'unlock' a locked block.
- [evidence] \#7700 Evidence messages contain single Evidence instead of EvidenceList (@jmalicevic)
- [pubsub] \#7319 Performance improvements for the event query API (@creachadair)
- [node] \#7521 Define concrete type for seed node implementation (@spacech1mp)
- [rpc] \#7612 paginate mempool /unconfirmed_txs rpc endpoint (@spacech1mp)
- [light] [\#7536](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/7536) rpc /status call returns info about the light client (@jmalicevic)
- [types] \#7765 Replace EvidenceData with EvidenceList to avoid unnecessary nesting of evidence fields within a block. (@jmalicevic)

### BUG FIXES

- fix: assignment copies lock value in `BitArray.UnmarshalJSON()` (@lklimek)
- [light] \#7640 Light Client: fix absence proof verification (@ashcherbakov)
- [light] \#7641 Light Client: fix querying against the latest height (@ashcherbakov)
