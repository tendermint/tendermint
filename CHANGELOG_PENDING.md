### BREAKING CHANGES

- CLI/RPC/Config
  - [config] \#9259 Rename the fastsync section and the fast_sync key blocksync and block_sync respectively

- Apps
  - [abci/counter] \#6684 Delete counter example app
  - [abci] \#5783 Make length delimiter encoding consistent (`uint64`) between ABCI and P2P wire-level protocols
  - [abci] \#9145 Removes unused Response/Request `SetOption` from ABCI (@samricotta)
  - [abci/params] \#9287 Deduplicate `ConsensusParams` and `BlockParams` so only `types` proto definitions are used (@cmwaters)
    - Remove `TimeIotaMs` and use a hard-coded 1 millisecond value to ensure monotonically increasing block times.
    - Rename `AppVersion` to `App` so as to not stutter.
  - [types] \#9287 Reduce the use of protobuf types in core logic. (@cmwaters)
    - `ConsensusParams`, `BlockParams`, `ValidatorParams`, `EvidenceParams`, `VersionParams` have become native types.
      They still utilize protobuf when being sent over the wire or written to disk.
    - Moved `ValidateConsensusParams` inside (now native type) `ConsensusParams`, and renamed it to `ValidateBasic`.
  - [abci] \#9301 New ABCI methods `PrepareProposal` and `ProcessProposal` which give the app control over transactions proposed and allows for verification of proposed blocks.
  - [abci] \#8216 Renamed `EvidenceType` to `MisbehaviorType` and `Evidence` to `Misbehavior` as a more accurate label of their contents. (@williambanfield, @sergio-mena)
  - [abci] \#9122 Renamed `LastCommitInfo` to `CommitInfo` in preparation for vote extensions. (@cmwaters)
  - [abci] \#8656, \#8901 Added cli commands for `PrepareProposal` and `ProcessProposal`. (@jmalicevic, @hvanz)
  - [abci] \#6403 Change the `key` and `value` fields from `[]byte` to `string` in the `EventAttribute` type. (@alexanderbez)

- P2P Protocol

- Go API
    - [all] \#9144 Change spelling from British English to American (@cmwaters)
        - Rename "Subscription.Cancelled()" to "Subscription.Canceled()" in libs/pubsub
    - [crypto/sr25519] \#6526 Do not re-execute the Ed25519-style key derivation step when doing signing and verification.  The derivation is now done once and only once.  This breaks `sr25519.GenPrivKeyFromSecret` output compatibility. (@Yawning)

- Blockchain Protocol

### FEATURES

- [abci] \#9301 New ABCI methods `PrepareProposal` and `ProcessProposal` which give the app control over transactions proposed and allows for verification of proposed blocks.

### IMPROVEMENTS
- [crypto] \#9250 Update to use btcec v2 and the latest btcutil. (@wcsiu)

- [cli] \#9171 add `--hard` flag to rollback command (and a boolean to the `RollbackState` method). This will rollback
  state and remove the last block. This command can be triggered multiple times. The application must also rollback
  state to the same height. (@tsutsu, @cmwaters)
- [proto] \#9356 Migrate from `gogo/protobuf` to `cosmos/gogoproto` (@julienrbrt)
- [rpc] \#9276 Added `header` and `header_by_hash` queries to the RPC client (@samricotta)
- [abci] \#5706 Added `AbciVersion` to `RequestInfo` allowing applications to check ABCI version when connecting to Tendermint. (@marbar3778)
- [node] \#6059 Validate and complete genesis doc before saving to state store (@silasdavis)

- [crypto/ed25519] \#5632 Adopt zip215 `ed25519` verification. (@marbar3778)
- [crypto/ed25519] \#6526 Use [curve25519-voi](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/curve25519-voi) for `ed25519` signing and verification. (@Yawning)
- [crypto/sr25519] \#6526 Use [curve25519-voi](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/curve25519-voi) for `sr25519` signing and verification. (@Yawning)
- [crypto] \#6120 Implement batch verification interface for ed25519 and sr25519. (@marbar3778 & @Yawning)
- [types] \#6120 use batch verification for verifying commits signatures. (@marbar3778 & @cmwaters & @Yawning)
    - If the key type supports the batch verification API it will try to batch verify. If the verification fails we will single verify each signature.
- [state] \#9505 Added logic so when pruning, the evidence period is taken into consideration and only deletes unecessary data (@samricotta)

### BUG FIXES

- [consensus] \#9229 fix round number of `enterPropose` when handling `RoundStepNewRound` timeout. (@fatcat22)
- [docker] \#9073 enable cross platform build using docker buildx
- [blocksync] \#9518 handle the case when the sending queue is full: retry block request after a timeout
