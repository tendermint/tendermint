# Unreleased Changes

## v0.34.1

Special thanks to external contributors on this release:

@p4u from vocdoni.io reported that the mempool might behave incorrectly under a
high load. The consequences can range from pauses between blocks to the peers
disconnecting from this node. As a temporary remedy (until the mempool package
is refactored), the `max-batch-bytes` was disabled. Transactions will be sent
one by one without batching.

Friendly reminder, we have a [bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/tendermint).
