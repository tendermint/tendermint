## v0.32.9

\*\*

This release contains breaking changes to the `Block#Header`, specifically
`NumTxs` and `TotalTxs` were removed (\#2521). Here's how this change affects
different modules:

- apps: it breaks the ABCI header field numbering
- state: it breaks the format of `State` on disk
- RPC: all RPC requests which expose the header broke
- Go API: the `Header` broke
- P2P: since blocks go over the wire, technically the P2P protocol broke

Also, blocks are significantly smaller ðŸ”¥ because we got rid of the redundant
information in `Block#LastCommit`. `Commit` now mainly consists of a signature
and a validator address plus a timestamp. Note we may remove the validator
address & timestamp fields in the future (see ADR-25).

### BREAKING CHANGES:

- CLI/RPC/Config

  - [rpc] \#3471 Paginate `/validators` response (default: 30 vals per page)
  - [rpc] \#3188 Remove `BlockMeta` in `ResultBlock` in favor of `BlockId` for `/block`
  - [rpc] `/block_results` response format updated (see RPC docs for details)
    ```
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": "",
      "result": {
        "height": "2109",
        "txs_results": null,
        "begin_block_events": null,
        "end_block_events": null,
        "validator_updates": null,
        "consensus_param_updates": null
      }
    }
    ```
  - [rpc] [\#4141](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/4141) Remove `#event` suffix from the ID in event responses.
    `{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 0, "result": ...}`
  - [rpc] [\#4141](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/4141) Switch to integer IDs instead of `json-client-XYZ`
    ```
    id=0 method=/subscribe
    id=0 result=...
    id=1 method=/abci_query
    id=1 result=...
    ```
    - ID is unique for each request;
    - Request.ID is now optional. Notification is a Request without an ID. Previously ID="" or ID=0 were considered as notifications.

  - [config] \#4046 Rename tag(s) to CompositeKey & places where tag is still present it was renamed to event or events. Find how a compositeKey is constructed [here](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/6d05c531f7efef6f0619155cf10ae8557dd7832f/docs/app-dev/indexing-transactions.md)
    - You will have to generate a new config for your Tendermint node(s)
