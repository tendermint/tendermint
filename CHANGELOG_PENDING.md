### BREAKING CHANGES:

- CLI/RPC/Config
  - [rpc] \#3471 Paginate `/validators` response (default: 30 vals per page)
  - [rpc] \#3188 Remove `BlockMeta` in `ResultBlock` in favor of `BlockId` for `/block`
  - [rpc] `/block_results` response format updated (see RPC docs for details)
    ```
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": "",
      "result": {
        "height": "2109",
        "txs_results": null,
        "begin_block_events": null,
        "end_block_events": null,
        "validator_updates": null,
        "consensus_param_updates": null
      }
    }
    ```
  - [rpc] [\#4141](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/4141) Remove `#event` suffix from the ID in event responses.
    `{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 0, "result": ...}`
  - [rpc] [\#4141](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/4141) Switch to integer IDs instead of `json-client-XYZ`
    ```
    id=0 method=/subscribe
    id=0 result=...
    id=1 method=/abci_query
    id=1 result=...
    ```
    * ID is unique for each request;
    * Request.ID is now optional. Notification is a Request without an ID. Previously ID="" or ID=0 were considered as notifications.
