# Unreleased Changes

## v0.34.21

Release highlights include:
- A new `[storage]` configuration section and flag `discard_abci_responses`,
  which, if enabled, discards all ABCI responses except the latest one in order
  to reduce disk space usage in the state store. When enabled, the
  `block_results` RPC endpoint can no longer function and will return an error.
- A new CLI command, `reindex-event`, to re-index block and tx events to the
  event sinks. You can run this command when the event store backend
  dropped/disconnected or you want to replace the backend. When
  `discard_abci_responses` is enabled, you will not be able to use this command.
