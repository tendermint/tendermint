# Test data for `confix` and `condiff`

The files in this directory are stock Tendermint configuration files generated
by the last point release of each version series from v0.26 to present, along
with diffs between consecutive versions.

## Config Samples

The files named `vXX-config.toml` were generated by checking out and building
the corresponding version of Tendermint v0.xx.y and initializing a new node in
an empty home directory. The resulting `config.toml` file was copied here.
The exact build instructions vary a bit, but a general repro looks like:

```shell
# This example uses v0.31, substitute the version of your choice.
# Note that the branch names and tags may differ.
# Versions prior to v0.26 may not build.
git checkout v0.31.9
git clean -fdx

# Versions prior to v0.32 do not have Go module files.
# Those that do may need some dependencies manually updated.
go mod init github.com/tendermint/tendermint
go mod tidy
go get golang.org/x/sys

# Once you sort out the dependencies, this should usually work.
make build

# Confirm you go the version you expected, and generate the file.
./build/tendermint --home=tmhome version
./build/tendermint --home=tmhome init

# Copy the file out.
cp ./tmhome/config/config.toml v31-config.toml
```

## Version Diffs

The files named `diff-XX-YY.txt` were generated by using the `condiff` tool on
the config samples for versions v0.XX and v0.YY:

```shell
go run ./scripts/condiff -desnake vXX-config vYY-config.toml > diff-XX-YY.txt
```

The `baseline.txt` was computed in the same way, but using an empty starting
file so that we capture all the settings in the target:

```shell
go run ./scripts/condiff -desnake /dev/null v26-config.toml > baseline.txt
```
