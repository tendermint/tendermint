# This is a temporary directory to hold the peg binary,
# to work around https://github.com/pointlander/peg/issues/129.
# Note that once we have a new version of peg fixing #129,
# we may still want to keep this .gitignore to prevent anyone
# from accidentally running "git add ." and including their built
# peg binary in a commit.
