 - types: `Signer.Sign` returns an error.
 - state: every validator set change is persisted to disk, which required some changes to the `State` structure.
 - p2p: new `p2p.Peer` interface used for all reactor methods (instead of `*p2p.Peer` struct).

FEATURES:
 - rpc: `/validators?height=X` allows querying of validators at previous heights.
 - rpc: Leaving the `height` param empty for `/block`, `/validators`, and `/commit` will return the value for the latest height.

  - new config option, `consensus.create_empty_blocks_interval`; an empty block is created after this many seconds.
  - in normal operation, `create_empty_blocks = true` and `create_empty_blocks_interval = 0`, so blocks are being created all the time (as in all previous versions of tendermint). The number of empty blocks can be reduced by increasing `create_empty_blocks_interval` or by setting `create_empty_blocks = false`.
  - new `TxsAvailable()` method added to Mempool that returns a channel which fires when txs are available.
  - new heartbeat message added to consensus reactor to notify peers that a node is waiting for txs before entering propose step.

## 0.10.0 (June 2, 2017)

Includes major updates to configuration, logging, and json serialization.
Also includes the Grand Repo-Merge of 2017.

BREAKING CHANGES:

- Config and Flags:
  - The `config` map is replaced with a [`Config` struct](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/master/config/config.go#L11),
containing substructs: `BaseConfig`, `P2PConfig`, `MempoolConfig`, `ConsensusConfig`, `RPCConfig`
  - This affects the following flags:
    - `--seeds` is now `--p2p.seeds`
    - `--node_laddr` is now `--p2p.laddr`
    - `--pex` is now `--p2p.pex`
    - `--skip_upnp` is now `--p2p.skip_upnp`
    - `--rpc_laddr` is now `--rpc.laddr`
    - `--grpc_laddr` is now `--rpc.grpc_laddr`
  - Any configuration option now within a substract must come under that heading in the `config.toml`, for instance:
    ```
    [p2p]
    laddr="tcp://1.2.3.4:46656"

    [consensus]
    timeout_propose=1000
    ```
  - Use viper and `DefaultConfig() / TestConfig()` functions to handle defaults, and remove `config/tendermint` and `config/tendermint_test`
  - Change some function and method signatures to
  - Change some [function and method signatures](https://gist.github.com/ebuchman/640d5fc6c2605f73497992fe107ebe0b) accomodate new config

- Logger
  - Replace static `log15` logger with a simple interface, and provide a new implementation using `go-kit`.
See our new [logging library](https://github.com/tendermint/tmlibs/log) and [blog post](https://tendermint.com/blog/abstracting-the-logger-interface-in-go) for more details
  - Levels `warn` and `notice` are removed (you may need to change them in your `config.toml`!)
  - Change some [function and method signatures](https://gist.github.com/ebuchman/640d5fc6c2605f73497992fe107ebe0b) to accept a logger

- JSON serialization:
  - Replace `[TypeByte, Xxx]` with `{"type": "some-type", "data": Xxx}` in RPC and all `.json` files by using `go-wire/data`. For instance, a public key is now:
    ```
    "pub_key": {
      "type": "ed25519",
      "data": "83DDF8775937A4A12A2704269E2729FCFCD491B933C4B0A7FFE37FE41D7760D0"
    }
    ```
  - Remove type information about RPC responses, so `[TypeByte, {"jsonrpc": "2.0", ... }]` is now just `{"jsonrpc": "2.0", ... }`
  - Change `[]byte` to `data.Bytes` in all serialized types (for hex encoding)
  - Lowercase the JSON tags in `ValidatorSet` fields
  - Introduce `EventDataInner` for serializing events

- Other:
  - Send InitChain message in handshake if `appBlockHeight == 0`
  - Do not include the `Accum` field when computing the validator hash. This makes the ValidatorSetHash unique for a given validator set, rather than changing with every block (as the Accum changes)
  - Unsafe RPC calls are not enabled by default. This includes `/dial_seeds`, and all calls prefixed with `unsafe`. Use the `--rpc.unsafe` flag to enable.


FEATURES:

- Per-module log levels. For instance, the new default is `state:info,*:error`, which means the `state` package logs at `info` level, and everything else logs at `error` level
- Log if a node is validator or not in every consensus round
- Use ldflags to set git hash as part of the version
- Ignore `address` and `pub_key` fields in `priv_validator.json` and overwrite them with the values derrived from the `priv_key`

IMPROVEMENTS:

- Merge `tendermint/go-p2p -> tendermint/tendermint/p2p` and `tendermint/go-rpc -> tendermint/tendermint/rpc/lib`
- Update paths for grand repo merge:
  - `go-common -> tmlibs/common`
  - `go-data -> go-wire/data`
  - All other `go-` libs, except `go-crypto` and `go-wire`, are merged under `tmlibs`
- No global loggers (loggers are passed into constructors, or preferably set with a SetLogger method)
- Return HTTP status codes with errors for RPC responses
- Limit `/blockchain_info` call to return a maximum of 20 blocks
- Use `.Wrap()` and `.Unwrap()` instead of eg. `PubKeyS` for `go-crypto` types
- RPC JSON responses use pretty printing (via `json.MarshalIndent`)
- Color code different instances of the consensus for tests
- Isolate viper to `cmd/tendermint/commands` and do not read config from file for tests


## 0.9.2 (April 26, 2017)

BUG FIXES:

- Fix bug in `ResetPrivValidator` where we were using the global config and log (causing external consumers, eg. basecoin, to fail).

## 0.9.1 (April 21, 2017)

FEATURES:

- Transaction indexing - txs are indexed by their hash using a simple key-value store; easily extended to more advanced indexers
- New `/tx?hash=X` endpoint to query for transactions and their DeliverTx result by hash. Optionally returns a proof of the tx's inclusion in the block
- `tendermint testnet` command initializes files for a testnet

IMPROVEMENTS:

- CLI now uses Cobra framework
- TMROOT is now TMHOME (TMROOT will stop working in 0.10.0)
- `/broadcast_tx_XXX` also returns the Hash (can be used to query for the tx)
- `/broadcast_tx_commit` also returns the height the block was committed in
- ABCIResponses struct persisted to disk before calling Commit; makes handshake replay much cleaner
- WAL uses #ENDHEIGHT instead of #HEIGHT (#HEIGHT will stop working in 0.10.0)
- Peers included via `--seeds`, under `seeds` in the config, or in `/dial_seeds` are now persistent, and will be reconnected to if the connection breaks

BUG FIXES:

- Fix bug in fast-sync where we stop syncing after a peer is removed, even if they're re-added later
- Fix handshake replay to handle validator set changes and results of DeliverTx when we crash after app.Commit but before state.Save()

## 0.9.0 (March 6, 2017)

BREAKING CHANGES:

- Update ABCI to v0.4.0, where Query is now `Query(RequestQuery) ResponseQuery`, enabling precise proofs at particular heights:

```
message RequestQuery{
	bytes data = 1;
	string path = 2;
	uint64 height = 3;
	bool prove = 4;
}

message ResponseQuery{
	CodeType          code        = 1;
	int64             index       = 2;
	bytes             key         = 3;
	bytes             value       = 4;
	bytes             proof       = 5;
	uint64            height      = 6;
	string            log         = 7;
}
```


- `BlockMeta` data type unifies its Hash and PartSetHash under a `BlockID`:

```
type BlockMeta struct {
	BlockID BlockID `json:"block_id"` // the block hash and partsethash
	Header  *Header `json:"header"`   // The block's Header
}
```

- `ValidatorSet.Proposer` is exposed as a field and persisted with the `State`. Use `GetProposer()` to initialize or update after validator-set changes.

- `tendermint gen_validator` command output is now pure JSON

FEATURES:

- New RPC endpoint `/commit?height=X` returns header and commit for block at height `X`
- Client API for each endpoint, including mocks for testing

IMPROVEMENTS:

- `Node` is now a `BaseService`
- Simplified starting Tendermint in-process from another application
- Better organized Makefile
- Scripts for auto-building binaries across platforms
- Docker image improved, slimmed down (using Alpine), and changed from tendermint/tmbase to tendermint/tendermint
- New repo files: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, Github `ISSUE_TEMPLATE`, `CHANGELOG.md`
- Improvements on CircleCI for managing build/test artifacts
- Handshake replay is doen through the consensus package, possibly using a mockApp
- Graceful shutdown of RPC listeners
- Tests for the PEX reactor and DialSeeds

BUG FIXES:

- Check peer.Send for failure before updating PeerState in consensus
- Fix panic in `/dial_seeds` with invalid addresses
- Fix proposer selection logic in ValidatorSet by taking the address into account in the `accumComparable`
- Fix inconcistencies with `ValidatorSet.Proposer` across restarts by persisting it in the `State`


## 0.8.0 (January 13, 2017)

BREAKING CHANGES:

- New data type `BlockID` to represent blocks:

```
type BlockID struct {
	Hash        []byte        `json:"hash"`
	PartsHeader PartSetHeader `json:"parts"`
}
```

- `Vote` data type now includes validator address and index:

```
type Vote struct {
	ValidatorAddress []byte           `json:"validator_address"`
	ValidatorIndex   int              `json:"validator_index"`
	Height           int              `json:"height"`
	Round            int              `json:"round"`
	Type             byte             `json:"type"`
	BlockID          BlockID          `json:"block_id"` // zero if vote is nil.
	Signature        crypto.Signature `json:"signature"`
}
```

- Update TMSP to v0.3.0, where it is now called ABCI and AppendTx is DeliverTx
- Hex strings in the RPC are now "0x" prefixed


FEATURES:

- New message type on the ConsensusReactor, `Maj23Msg`, for peers to alert others they've seen a Maj23,
in order to track and handle conflicting votes intelligently to prevent Byzantine faults from causing halts:

```
type VoteSetMaj23Message struct {
	Height  int
	Round   int
	Type    byte
	BlockID types.BlockID
}
```

- Configurable block part set size
- Validator set changes
- Optionally skip TimeoutCommit if we have all the votes
- Handshake between Tendermint and App on startup to sync latest state and ensure consistent recovery from crashes
- GRPC server for BroadcastTx endpoint

IMPROVEMENTS:

- Less verbose logging
- Better test coverage (37% -> 49%)
- Canonical SignBytes for signable types
- Write-Ahead Log for Mempool and Consensus via tmlibs/autofile
- Better in-process testing for the consensus reactor and byzantine faults
- Better crash/restart testing for individual nodes at preset failure points, and of networks at arbitrary points
- Better abstraction over timeout mechanics

BUG FIXES:

- Fix memory leak in mempool peer
- Fix panic on POLRound=-1
- Actually set the CommitTime
- Actually send BeginBlock message
- Fix a liveness issues caused by Byzantine proposals/votes. Uses the new `Maj23Msg`.

## PreHistory

Strict versioning only began with the release of v0.7.0, in late summer 2016.
The project itself began in early summer 2014 and was workable decentralized cryptocurrency software by the end of that year.
Through the course of 2015, in collaboration with Eris Industries (now Monax Indsutries),
many additional features were integrated, including an implementation from scratch of the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
That implementation now forms the heart of [Burrow](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow).
In the later half of 2015, the consensus algorithm was upgraded with a more asynchronous design and a more deterministic and robust implementation.

By late 2015, frustration with the difficulty of forking a large monolithic stack to create alternative cryptocurrency designs led to the
invention of the Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI), then called the Tendermint Socket Protocol (TMSP).
The Ethereum Virtual Machine and various other transaction features were removed, and Tendermint was whittled down to a core consensus engine
driving an application running in another process.
The ABCI interface and implementation were iterated on and improved over the course of 2016,
until versioned history kicked in with v0.7.0.
