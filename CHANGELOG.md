This release includes a fix for a high-severity security vulnerability. 
More information on this vulnerability will be released on January 26, 2021
and this changelog will be updated. 

It also updates GoGo Protobuf to 1.3.2 in order to pick up the fix for
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3121. 

Friendly reminder: We have a [bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/tendermint).

### BUG FIXES

- [evidence] [N/A] Use correct source of evidence time (@cmwaters)
- [proto] [\#5886](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/5889) Bump gogoproto to 1.3.2 (@marbar3778)

## v0.34.2

*January 12, 2021*

This release fixes a substantial bug in evidence handling where evidence could
sometimes be broadcast before the block containing that evidence was fully committed,
resulting in some nodes panicking when trying to verify said evidence.

Friendly reminder, we have a [bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/tendermint).

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Go API
  - [libs/os] [\#5871](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/5871) `EnsureDir` now propagates IO errors and checks the file type (@erikgrinaker)

### BUG FIXES

- [evidence] [\#5890](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/5890) Add a buffer to evidence from consensus to avoid broadcasting and proposing evidence before the
  height of such an evidence has finished (@cmwaters)
- [statesync] [\#5889](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/5889) Set `LastHeightConsensusParamsChanged` when bootstrapping Tendermint state (@cmwaters)

## v0.34.1

*January 6, 2021*

Special thanks to external contributors on this release:

@p4u from vocdoni.io reported that the mempool might behave incorrectly under a
high load. The consequences can range from pauses between blocks to the peers
disconnecting from this node. As a temporary remedy (until the mempool package
is refactored), the `max-batch-bytes` was disabled. Transactions will be sent
one by one without batching.

Friendly reminder, we have a [bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/tendermint).

## v0.33.8

*August 11, 2020*

### Go security update

Go reported a security vulnerability that affected the `encoding/binary` package. The most recent binary for tendermint is using 1.14.6, for this
reason the Tendermint engineering team has opted to conduct a release to aid users in using the correct version of Go. Read more about the security issue [here](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/40618).


## v0.33.7

 *August 4, 2020*

 ### BUG FIXES:

 - [go] Build release binary using Go 1.14.4, to avoid halt caused by Go 1.14.1 (https://github.com/golang/go/issues/38223)
 - [privval] [\#5140](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/5140) `RemoteSignerError` from remote signers are no longer retried (@melekes)


## v0.33.6

*July 2, 2020*

This security release fixes:

### Denial of service

Tendermint 0.33.0 and above allow block proposers to include signatures for the
wrong block. This may happen naturally if you start a network, have it run for
some time and restart it **without changing the chainID**. (It is a
[misconfiguration](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/tendermint-core/using-tendermint.html)
to reuse chainIDs.) Correct block proposers will accidentally include signatures
for the wrong block if they see these signatures, and then commits won't validate,
making all proposed blocks invalid. A malicious validator (even with a minimal
amount of stake) can use this vulnerability to completely halt the network.

Tendermint 0.33.6 checks all the signatures are for the block with +2/3
majority before creating a commit.

### False Witness

Tendermint 0.33.1 and above are no longer fully verifying commit signatures
during block execution - they stop after +2/3. This means proposers can propose
blocks that contain valid +2/3 signatures and then the rest of the signatures
can be whatever they want. They can claim that all the other validators signed
just by including a CommitSig with arbitrary signature data. While this doesn't
seem to impact safety of Tendermint per se, it means that Commits may contain a
lot of invalid data.

_This was already true of blocks, since they could include invalid txs filled
with garbage, but in that case the application knew that they are invalid and
could punish the proposer. But since applications didn't--and don't--
verify commit signatures directly (they trust Tendermint to do that),
they won't be able to detect it._

This can impact incentivization logic in the application that depends on the
LastCommitInfo sent in BeginBlock, which includes which validators signed. For
instance, Gaia incentivizes proposers with a bonus for including more than +2/3
of the signatures. But a proposer can now claim that bonus just by including
arbitrary data for the final -1/3 of validators without actually waiting for
their signatures. There may be other tricks that can be played because of this.

Tendermint 0.33.6 verifies all the signatures during block execution.

_Please note that the light client does not check nil votes and exits as soon
as 2/3+ of the signatures are checked._

**All clients are recommended to upgrade.**

Special thanks to @njmurarka at Bluzelle Networks for reporting this.

### SECURITY:

- [consensus] Do not allow signatures for a wrong block in commits (@ebuchman)
- [consensus] Verify all the signatures during block execution (@melekes)

**Please note that the fix for the False Witness issue renames the `VerifyCommitTrusting`
function to `VerifyCommitLightTrusting`. If you were relying on the light client, you may
need to update your code.**

## v0.33.3

*April 6, 2020*

This security release fixes:

### Denial of service 1

Tendermint 0.33.2 and earlier does not limit P2P connection requests number.
For each p2p connection, Tendermint allocates ~0.5MB. Even though this
memory is garbage collected once the connection is terminated (due to duplicate
IP or reaching a maximum number of inbound peers), temporary memory spikes can
lead to OOM (Out-Of-Memory) exceptions.

Tendermint 0.33.3 (and 0.32.10) limits the total number of P2P incoming
connection requests to to `p2p.max_num_inbound_peers +
len(p2p.unconditional_peer_ids)`.

Notes:

- Tendermint does not rate limit P2P connection requests per IP (an attacker
  can saturate all the inbound slots);
- Tendermint does not rate limit HTTP(S) requests. If you expose any RPC
  endpoints to the public, please make sure to put in place some protection
  (https://www.nginx.com/blog/rate-limiting-nginx/). We may implement this in
  the future ([\#1696](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/1696)).

### Denial of service 2

Tendermint 0.33.2 and earlier does not reclaim `activeID` of a peer after it's
removed in `Mempool` reactor. This does not happen all the time. It only
happens when a connection fails (for any reason) before the Peer is created and
added to all reactors. `RemovePeer` is therefore called before `AddPeer`, which
leads to always growing memory (`activeIDs` map). The `activeIDs` map has a
maximum size of 65535 and the node will panic if this map reaches the maximum.
An attacker can create a lot of connection attempts (exploiting Denial of
service 1), which ultimately will lead to the node panicking.

Tendermint 0.33.3 (and 0.32.10) claims `activeID` for a peer in `InitPeer`,
which is executed before `MConnection` is started.

Notes:

- `InitPeer` function was added to all reactors to combat a similar issue -
  [\#3338](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3338);
- Denial of service 2 is independent of Denial of service 1 and can be executed
  without it.

**All clients are recommended to upgrade**

*January 14, 2020*

This release contains breaking changes to the `Block#Header`, specifically
`NumTxs` and `TotalTxs` were removed (\#2521). Here's how this change affects
different modules:

- apps: it breaks the ABCI header field numbering
- state: it breaks the format of `State` on disk
- RPC: all RPC requests which expose the header broke
- Go API: the `Header` broke
- P2P: since blocks go over the wire, technically the P2P protocol broke

Also, blocks are significantly smaller 🔥 because we got rid of the redundant
information in `Block#LastCommit`. `Commit` now mainly consists of a signature
and a validator address plus a timestamp. Note we may remove the validator
address & timestamp fields in the future (see ADR-25).

`lite2` package has been added to solve `lite` issues and introduce weak
subjectivity interface. Refer to the [spec](https://github.com/tendermint/spec/blob/master/spec/consensus/light-client.md) for complete details.
`lite` package is now deprecated and will be removed in v0.34 release.

### BREAKING CHANGES:

      "id": "",
      "result": {
        "height": "2109",
        "txs_results": null,
        "begin_block_events": null,
        "end_block_events": null,
        "validator_updates": null,
        "consensus_param_updates": null

    id=1 method=/abci_query
    id=1 result=...
    ```
    - ID is unique for each request;
    - Request.ID is now optional. Notification is a Request without an ID. Previously ID="" or ID=0 were considered as notifications.

  - [genesis] [\#2565](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/2565) Add `consensus_params.evidence.max_age_duration`. Rename
    `consensus_params.evidence.max_age` to `max_age_num_blocks`.
  - [cli] [\#1771](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/1771) `tendermint lite` now uses new light client package (`lite2`)
    and has 3 more flags: `--trusting-period`, `--trusted-height` and

## v0.32.10

*April 6, 2020*

This security release fixes:

### Denial of Service 1

Tendermint 0.33.2 and earlier does not limit the number of P2P connection
requests. For each p2p connection, Tendermint allocates ~0.5MB. Even though
this memory is garbage collected once the connection is terminated (due to
duplicate IP or reaching a maximum number of inbound peers), temporary memory
spikes can lead to OOM (Out-Of-Memory) exceptions.

Tendermint 0.33.3 (and 0.32.10) limits the total number of P2P incoming
connection requests to to `p2p.max_num_inbound_peers +
len(p2p.unconditional_peer_ids)`.

Notes:

- Tendermint does not rate limit P2P connection requests per IP (an attacker
  can saturate all the inbound slots);
- Tendermint does not rate limit HTTP(S) requests. If you expose any RPC
  endpoints to the public, please make sure to put in place some protection
  (https://www.nginx.com/blog/rate-limiting-nginx/). We may implement this in
  the future ([\#1696](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/1696)).

### Denial of Service 2

Tendermint 0.33.2 and earlier does not reclaim `activeID` of a peer after it's
removed in `Mempool` reactor. This does not happen all the time. It only
happens when a connection fails (for any reason) before the Peer is created and
added to all reactors. `RemovePeer` is therefore called before `AddPeer`, which
leads to always growing memory (`activeIDs` map). The `activeIDs` map has a
maximum size of 65535 and the node will panic if this map reaches the maximum.
An attacker can create a lot of connection attempts (exploiting Denial of
Service 1), which ultimately will lead to the node panicking.

Tendermint 0.33.3 (and 0.32.10) claims `activeID` for a peer in `InitPeer`,
which is executed before `MConnection` is started.

Notes:

- `InitPeer` function was added to all reactors to combat a similar issue -
  [\#3338](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3338);
- Denial of Service 2 is independent of Denial of Service 1 and can be executed
  without it.

## v0.32.7

*October 18, 2019*

This security release fixes a vulnerability found in the `consensus` package,
where an attacker could construct a `BlockPartMessage` message in such a way
that it will lead to consensus failure. A few similar issues have been
identified and fixed here.

**All clients are recommended to upgrade**

*October 8, 2019*

The previous patch was insufficient because the attacker could still find a way
to submit a `nil` pubkey by constructing a `PubKeyMultisigThreshold` pubkey
with `nil` subpubkeys for example.

This release provides multiple fixes, which include recovering from panics when
accepting new peers and only allowing `ed25519` pubkeys.

## v0.32.1

*July 15, 2019*

Special thanks to external contributors on this release:
@ParthDesai, @climber73, @jim380, @ashleyvega

This release contains a minor enhancement to the ABCI and some breaking changes to our libs folder, namely:
- CheckTx requests include a `CheckTxType` enum that can be set to `Recheck` to indicate to the application that this transaction was already checked/validated and certain expensive operations (like checking signatures) can be skipped
- Removed various functions from `libs` pkgs

Friendly reminder, we have a [bug bounty
program](https://hackerone.com/tendermint).

### BREAKING CHANGES:

- Go API

  -  [abci] [\#2127](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/2127) The CheckTx and DeliverTx methods in the ABCI `Application` interface now take structs  as arguments (RequestCheckTx and RequestDeliverTx, respectively), instead of just the raw tx bytes. This allows more information to be passed to these methods, for instance, indicating whether a tx has already been checked.
  - [libs] Remove unused `db/debugDB` and `common/colors.go` & `errors/errors.go` files (@marbar3778)
  - [libs] [\#2432](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/2432) Remove unused `common/heap.go` file (@marbar3778)
  - [libs] Remove unused `date.go`, `io.go`. Remove `GoPath()`, `Prompt()` and `IsDirEmpty()` functions from `os.go` (@marbar3778)
  - [libs] Remove unused `FailRand()` func and minor clean up to `fail.go`(@marbar3778)

### FEATURES:

- [node] Add variadic argument to `NewNode` to support functional options, allowing the Node to be more easily customized.
- [node][\#3730](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/3730) Add `CustomReactors` option to `NewNode` allowing caller to pass
  custom reactors to run inside Tendermint node (@ParthDesai)
- [abci] [\#2127](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/2127)RequestCheckTx has a new field, `CheckTxType`, which can take values of `CheckTxType_New` and `CheckTxType_Recheck`, indicating whether this is a new tx being checked for the first time or whether this tx is being rechecked after a block commit. This allows applications to skip certain expensive operations, like signature checking, if they've already been done once. see [docs](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/eddb433d7c082efbeaf8974413a36641519ee895/docs/spec/abci/apps.md#mempool-connection)

### IMPROVEMENTS:

- [rpc] [\#3700](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3700) Make possible to set absolute paths for TLS cert and key (@climber73)

## v0.32.0

*June 25, 2019*

Special thanks to external contributors on this release:
@needkane, @SebastianElvis, @andynog, @Yawning, @wooparadog

This release contains breaking changes to our build and release processes, ABCI,
and the RPC, namely:
- Use Go modules instead of dep
- Bring active development to the `master` Github branch
- ABCI Tags are now Events - see
  [docs](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/60827f75623b92eff132dc0eff5b49d2025c591e/docs/spec/abci/abci.md#events)
- Bind RPC to localhost by default, not to the public interface [UPGRADING/RPC_Changes](./UPGRADING.md#rpc_changes)

Friendly reminder, we have a [bug bounty
program](https://hackerone.com/tendermint).

### BREAKING CHANGES:

* CLI/RPC/Config
  - [cli] [\#3613](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3613) Switch from golang/dep to Go Modules to resolve dependencies:
    It is recommended to switch to Go Modules if your project has tendermint as
    a dependency. Read more on Modules here:
    https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules
  - [config] [\#3632](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/3632) Removed `leveldb` as generic
    option for `db_backend`. Must be `goleveldb` or `cleveldb`.
  - [rpc] [\#3616](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3616) Fix field names for `/block_results` response (eg. `results.DeliverTx`
    -> `results.deliver_tx`). See docs for details.
  - [rpc] [\#3724](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3724) RPC now binds to `127.0.0.1` by default instead of `0.0.0.0`

* Apps
  - [abci] [\#1859](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/1859) `ResponseCheckTx`, `ResponseDeliverTx`, `ResponseBeginBlock`,
    and `ResponseEndBlock` now include `Events` instead of `Tags`. Each `Event`
    contains a `type` and a list of `attributes` (list of key-value pairs)
    allowing for inclusion of multiple distinct events in each response.

* Go API
  - [abci] [\#3193](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3193) Use RequestDeliverTx and RequestCheckTx in the ABCI
    Application interface
  - [libs/db] [\#3632](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/3632) Removed deprecated `LevelDBBackend` const
    If you have `db_backend` set to `leveldb` in your config file, please
    change it to `goleveldb` or `cleveldb`.
  - [p2p] [\#3521](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3521) Remove NewNetAddressStringWithOptionalID

* Blockchain Protocol

* P2P Protocol

### FEATURES:

### IMPROVEMENTS:
- [abci/examples] [\#3659](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3659) Change validator update tx format in the `persistent_kvstore` to use base64 for pubkeys instead of hex (@needkane)
- [consensus] [\#3656](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3656) Exit if SwitchToConsensus fails
- [p2p] [\#3666](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3666) Add per channel telemetry to improve reactor observability
- [rpc] [\#3686](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/3686) `HTTPClient#Call` returns wrapped errors, so a caller could use `errors.Cause` to retrieve an error code. (@wooparadog)

### BUG FIXES:
- [libs/db] [\#3717](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3717) Fixed the BoltDB backend's Batch.Delete implementation (@Yawning)
- [libs/db] [\#3718](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3718) Fixed the BoltDB backend's Get and Iterator implementation (@Yawning)
- [node] [\#3716](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3716) Fix a bug where `nil` is recorded as node's address
- [node] [\#3741](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3741) Fix profiler blocking the entire node

*Tendermint 0.31 release series has reached End-Of-Life and is no longer supported.*

## v0.31.12

*April 6, 2020*

This security release fixes:

### Denial of Service 1

Tendermint 0.33.2 and earlier does not limit the number of P2P connection requests.
For each p2p connection, Tendermint allocates ~0.5MB. Even though this
memory is garbage collected once the connection is terminated (due to duplicate
IP or reaching a maximum number of inbound peers), temporary memory spikes can
lead to OOM (Out-Of-Memory) exceptions.

Tendermint 0.33.3, 0.32.10, and 0.31.12 limit the total number of P2P incoming
connection requests to to `p2p.max_num_inbound_peers +
len(p2p.unconditional_peer_ids)`.

Notes:

- Tendermint does not rate limit P2P connection requests per IP (an attacker
  can saturate all the inbound slots);
- Tendermint does not rate limit HTTP(S) requests. If you expose any RPC
  endpoints to the public, please make sure to put in place some protection
  (https://www.nginx.com/blog/rate-limiting-nginx/). We may implement this in
  the future ([\#1696](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/1696)).

### Denial of Service 2

Tendermint 0.33.2 and earlier does not reclaim `activeID` of a peer after it's
removed in `Mempool` reactor. This does not happen all the time. It only
happens when a connection fails (for any reason) before the Peer is created and
added to all reactors. `RemovePeer` is therefore called before `AddPeer`, which
leads to always growing memory (`activeIDs` map). The `activeIDs` map has a
maximum size of 65535 and the node will panic if this map reaches the maximum.
An attacker can create a lot of connection attempts (exploiting Denial of
Service 1), which ultimately will lead to the node panicking.

Tendermint 0.33.3, 0.32.10, and 0.31.12 claim `activeID` for a peer in `InitPeer`,
which is executed before `MConnection` is started.

Notes:

- `InitPeer` function was added to all reactors to combat a similar issue -
  [\#3338](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3338);
- Denial of Service 2 is independent of Denial of Service 1 and can be executed
  without it.

### SECURITY:

- [mempool] Reserve IDs in InitPeer instead of AddPeer (@tessr)
- [p2p] Limit the number of incoming connections (@melekes)

## v0.31.11

*October 18, 2019*

This security release fixes a vulnerability found in the `consensus` package,
where an attacker could construct a `BlockPartMessage` message in such a way
that it will lead to consensus failure. A few similar issues have been
identified and fixed here.

**All clients are recommended to upgrade**

Special thanks to [elvishacker](https://hackerone.com/elvishacker) for finding
and reporting this.

Friendly reminder, we have a [bug bounty
program](https://hackerone.com/tendermint).

### BREAKING CHANGES:

- Go API
  - [consensus] Modify `WAL#Write` and `WAL#WriteSync` to return an error if
    they fail to write a message

### SECURITY:

- [consensus] Validate incoming messages more throughly

## v0.31.10

*October 8, 2019*

The previous patch was insufficient because the attacker could still find a way
to submit a `nil` pubkey by constructing a `PubKeyMultisigThreshold` pubkey
with `nil` subpubkeys for example.

This release provides multiple fixes, which include recovering from panics when
accepting new peers and only allowing `ed25519` pubkeys.

**All clients are recommended to upgrade**

Special thanks to [fudongbai](https://hackerone.com/fudongbai) for pointing
this out.

### SECURITY:

- [p2p] [\#4030](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/4030) Only allow ed25519 pubkeys when connecting

## v0.31.9

*October 1, 2019*

This release fixes a major security vulnerability found in the `p2p` package.
All clients are recommended to upgrade. See
[\#4030](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/4030) for details.

Special thanks to [fudongbai](https://hackerone.com/fudongbai) for discovering
and reporting this issue.

### SECURITY:

- [p2p] [\#4030](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/4030) Fix for panic on nil public key send to a peer

### BUG FIXES:

- [node] [\#3716](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3716) Fix a bug where `nil` is recorded as node's address
- [node] [\#3741](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3741) Fix profiler blocking the entire node

## v0.31.8

*July 29, 2019*

This releases fixes one bug in the PEX reactor and adds a `recover` to the Go's
ABCI server, which allows it to properly cleanup.

### IMPROVEMENTS:
- [abci] [\#3809](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3809) Recover from application panics in `server/socket_server.go` to allow socket cleanup (@ruseinov)

### BUG FIXES:
- [p2p] [\#3338](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3338) Prevent "sent next PEX request too soon" errors by not calling
  ensurePeers outside of ensurePeersRoutine

## v0.31.7

*June 3, 2019*

This releases fixes a regression in the mempool introduced in v0.31.6.
The regression caused the invalid committed txs to be proposed in blocks over and
over again.

### BUG FIXES:
- [mempool] [\#3699](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3699) Remove all committed txs from the mempool.
    This reverts the change from v0.31.6 where we only remove valid txs from the mempool.
    Note this means malicious proposals can cause txs to be dropped from the
    mempools of other nodes by including them in blocks before they are valid.
    See [\#3322](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3322).

## v0.31.6

*May 31st, 2019*

This release contains many fixes and improvements, primarily for p2p functionality.
It also fixes a security issue in the mempool package.

With this release, Tendermint now supports [boltdb](https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt), although
in experimental mode. Feel free to try and report to us any findings/issues.
Note also that the build tags for compiling CLevelDB have changed.

### OTHERS:
- [networks] fixes ansible integration script (@carlosflrs)

## v0.31.5

*April 16th, 2019*

This release fixes a regression from v0.31.4 where, in existing chains that
were upgraded, `/validators` could return an empty validator set. This is true
for almost all heights, given the validator set remains the same.

Special thanks to external contributors on this release:
@brapse, @guagualvcha, @dongsam, @phucc

### IMPROVEMENTS:

- [libs/common] `CMap`: slight optimization in `Keys()` and `Values()` (@phucc)
- [gitignore] gitignore: add .vendor-new (@dongsam)

### BUG FIXES:

- [state] [\#3537](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/3537#issuecomment-482711833)
  `LoadValidators`: do not return an empty validator set
- [blockchain] [\#3457](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3457)
  Fix "peer did not send us anything" in `fast_sync` mode when under high pressure

## v0.31.4

*April 12th, 2019*

This release fixes a regression from v0.31.3 which used the peer's `SocketAddr` to add the peer to
the address book. This swallowed the peer's self-reported port which is important in case of reconnect.
It brings back `NetAddress()` to `NodeInfo` and uses it instead of `SocketAddr` for adding peers.
Additionally, it improves response time on the `/validators` or `/status` RPC endpoints.
As a side-effect it makes these RPC endpoint more difficult to DoS and fixes a performance degradation in `ExecCommitBlock`.
Also, it contains an [ADR](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/3539) that proposes decoupling the
responsibility for peer behaviour from the `p2p.Switch` (by @brapse).

Special thanks to external contributors on this release:
@brapse, @guagualvcha, @mydring

### IMPROVEMENTS:

- [p2p] [\#3463](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/3463) Do not log "Can't add peer's address to addrbook" error for a private peer
- [p2p] [\#3547](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/3547) Fix a couple of annoying typos (@mdyring)

### BUG FIXES:

- [docs] [\#3514](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3514) Fix block.Header.Time description (@melekes)
- [p2p] [\#2716](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/2716) Check if we're already connected to peer right before dialing it (@melekes)
- [p2p] [\#3545](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3545) Add back `NetAddress()` to `NodeInfo` and use it instead of peer's `SocketAddr()` when adding a peer to the `PEXReactor` (potential fix for [\#3532](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3532))
- [state] [\#3438](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/3438)
  Persist validators every 100000 blocks even if no changes to the set
  occurred (@guagualvcha). This
  1) Prevents possible DoS attack using `/validators` or `/status` RPC
  endpoints. Before response time was growing linearly with height if no
  changes were made to the validator set.
  2) Fixes performance degradation in `ExecCommitBlock` where we call
  `LoadValidators` for each `Evidence` in the block.

## v0.31.3

*April 1st, 2019*

This release includes two security sensitive fixes: it ensures generated private
keys are valid, and it prevents certain DNS lookups that would cause the node to
panic if the lookup failed.

### BREAKING CHANGES:
* Go API
  - [crypto/secp256k1] [\#3439](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3439)
    The `secp256k1.GenPrivKeySecp256k1` function has changed to guarantee that it returns a valid key, which means it
    will return a different private key than in previous versions for the same secret.

### BUG FIXES:

- [crypto/secp256k1] [\#3439](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3439)
    Ensure generated private keys are valid by randomly sampling until a valid key is found.
    Previously, it was possible (though rare!) to generate keys that exceeded the curve order.
    Such keys would lead to invalid signatures.
- [p2p] [\#3522](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3522) Memoize
  socket address in peer connections to avoid DNS lookups. Previously, failed
  DNS lookups could cause the node to panic.

## v0.31.2

*March 30th, 2019*

This release fixes a regression from v0.31.1 where Tendermint panics under

## v0.31.1

*March 27th, 2019*

This release contains a major improvement for the mempool that reduce the amount of sent data by about 30%
(see some numbers below).
It also fixes a memory leak in the mempool and adds TLS support to the RPC server by providing a certificate and key in the config.

- [mempool] [\#2778](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/2778) No longer send txs back to peers who sent it to you.
Also, limit to 65536 active peers.
This vastly improves the bandwidth consumption of nodes.
For instance, for a 4 node localnet, in a test sending 250byte txs for 120 sec. at 500 txs/sec (total of 15MB):
  - total bytes received from 1st node:
     - before: 42793967 (43MB)
     - after: 30003256 (30MB)
  - total bytes sent to 1st node:

## v0.31.0

*March 16th, 2019*

Special thanks to external contributors on this release:
@danil-lashin, @guagualvcha, @siburu, @silasdavis, @srmo, @Stumble, @svenstaro

This release is primarily about the new pubsub implementation, dubbed `pubsub 2.0`, and related changes,
like configurable limits on the number of active RPC subscriptions at a time (`max_subscription_clients`).
Pubsub 2.0 is an improved version of the older pubsub that is non-blocking and has a nicer API.
Note the improved pubsub API also resulted in some improvements to the HTTPClient interface and the API for WebSocket subscriptions.
This release also adds a configurable limit to the mempool size (`max_txs_bytes`, default 1GB)
and a configurable timeout for the `/broadcast_tx_commit` endpoint.

See the [v0.31.0
Milestone](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/milestone/19?closed=1) for
more details.

Friendly reminder, we have a [bug bounty
program](https://hackerone.com/tendermint).

### BREAKING CHANGES:

* CLI/RPC/Config
  - [config] [\#2920](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/2920) Remove `consensus.blocktime_iota` parameter
  - [rpc] [\#3227](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3227) New PubSub design does not block on clients when publishing
    messages. Slow clients may miss messages and receive an error, terminating
    the subscription.

## v0.30.2

*March 10th, 2019*

This release fixes a CLevelDB memory leak. It was happening because we were not
closing the WriteBatch object after use. See [levigo's
godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/jmhodges/levigo#WriteBatch.Close) for the
Close method. Special thanks goes to @Stumble who both reported an issue in
[cosmos-sdk](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/3842) and provided a
fix here.

### BREAKING CHANGES:

* Go API
  - [libs/db] [\#3842](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/3842) Add Close() method to Batch interface (@Stumble)

### BUG FIXES:
- [libs/db] [\#3842](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/3842) Fix CLevelDB memory leak (@Stumble)

## v0.30.1

*February 20th, 2019*

This release fixes a consensus halt and a DataCorruptionError after restart
discovered in `game_of_stakes_6`. It also fixes a security issue in the p2p
handshake by authenticating the NetAddress.ID of the peer we're dialing.

### IMPROVEMENTS:

* [config] [\#3291](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3291) Make
  config.ResetTestRootWithChainID() create concurrency-safe test directories.

### BUG FIXES:

* [consensus] [\#3295](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3295)
  Flush WAL on stop to prevent data corruption during graceful shutdown.
* [consensus] [\#3302](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3302)
  Fix possible halt by resetting TriggeredTimeoutPrecommit before starting next height.
* [rpc] [\#3251](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3251) Fix
  `/net_info#peers#remote_ip` format. New format spec:
  * dotted decimal ("192.0.2.1"), if ip is an IPv4 or IP4-mapped IPv6 address
  * IPv6 ("2001:db8::1"), if ip is a valid IPv6 address
* [cmd] [\#3314](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3314) Return
  an error on `show_validator` when the private validator file does not exist.
* [p2p] [\#3010](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3010#issuecomment-464287627)
  Authenticate a peer against its NetAddress.ID when dialing.

## v0.30.0

*February 8th, 2019*

This release fixes yet another issue with the proposer selection algorithm.
We hope it's the last one, but we won't be surprised if it's not.
We plan to one day expose the selection algorithm more directly to
the application ([\#3285](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3285)), and even to support randomness ([\#763](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/763)).
For more, see issues marked
[proposer-selection](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/labels/proposer-selection).

This release also includes a fix to prevent Tendermint from including the same
piece of evidence in more than one block. This issue was reported by @chengwenxi in our
[bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/tendermint).

### BREAKING CHANGES:

* Apps
  - [state] [\#3222](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3222)
    Duplicate updates for the same validator are forbidden. Apps must ensure
    that a given `ResponseEndBlock.ValidatorUpdates` contains only one entry per pubkey.

* Go API
  - [types] [\#3222](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3222)
    Remove `Add` and `Update` methods from `ValidatorSet` in favor of new
    `UpdateWithChangeSet`. This allows updates to be applied as a set, instead of
    one at a time.

* Block Protocol
  - [state] [\#3286](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3286) Blocks that include already committed evidence are invalid.

* P2P Protocol
  - [consensus] [\#3222](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3222)
    Validator updates are applied as a set, instead of one at a time, thus
    impacting the proposer priority calculation. This ensures that the proposer
    selection algorithm does not depend on the order of updates in
    `ResponseEndBlock.ValidatorUpdates`.

### IMPROVEMENTS:
- [crypto] [\#3279](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3279) Use `btcec.S256().N` directly instead of hard coding a copy.

### BUG FIXES:
- [state] [\#3222](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3222) Fix validator set updates so they are applied as a set, rather
  than one at a time. This makes the proposer selection algorithm independent of
  the order of updates in `ResponseEndBlock.ValidatorUpdates`.
- [evidence] [\#3286](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3286) Don't add committed evidence to evidence pool.

## v0.29.2

*February 7th, 2019*

Special thanks to external contributors on this release:
@ackratos, @rickyyangz

**Note**: This release contains security sensitive patches in the `p2p` and
`crypto` packages:
- p2p:
  - Partial fix for MITM attacks on the p2p connection. MITM conditions may
    still exist. See [\#3010](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3010).
- crypto:
  - Eliminate our fork of `btcd` and use the `btcd/btcec` library directly for
    native secp256k1 signing. Note we still modify the signature encoding to
    prevent malleability.
  - Support the libsecp256k1 library via CGo through the `go-ethereum/crypto/secp256k1` package.
  - Eliminate MixEntropy functions

### BREAKING CHANGES:

* Go API
  - [crypto] [\#3278](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3278) Remove
    MixEntropy functions
  - [types] [\#3245](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3245) Commit uses `type CommitSig Vote` instead of `Vote` directly.
    In preparation for removing redundant fields from the commit [\#1648](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/1648)

### IMPROVEMENTS:
- [consensus] [\#3246](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3246) Better logging and notes on recovery for corrupted WAL file
- [crypto] [\#3163](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3163) Use ethereum's libsecp256k1 go-wrapper for signatures when cgo is available
- [crypto] [\#3162](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3162) Wrap btcd instead of forking it to keep up with fixes (used if cgo is not available)
- [makefile] [\#3233](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3233) Use golangci-lint instead of go-metalinter
- [tools] [\#3218](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3218) Add go-deadlock tool to help detect deadlocks
- [tools] [\#3106](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3106) Add tm-signer-harness test harness for remote signers
- [tests] [\#3258](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3258) Fixed a bunch of non-deterministic test failures

### BUG FIXES:
- [node] [\#3186](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3186) EventBus and indexerService should be started before first block (for replay last block on handshake) execution (@ackratos)
- [p2p] [\#3232](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3232) Fix infinite loop leading to addrbook deadlock for seed nodes
- [p2p] [\#3247](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3247) Fix panic in SeedMode when calling FlushStop and OnStop
  concurrently
- [p2p] [\#3040](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3040) Fix MITM on secret connection by checking low-order points
- [privval] [\#3258](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3258) Fix race between sign requests and ping requests in socket that was causing messages to be corrupted

## v0.29.1

*January 24, 2019*

Special thanks to external contributors on this release:
@infinytum, @gauthamzz

This release contains two important fixes: one for p2p layer where we sometimes
were not closing connections and one for consensus layer where consensus with
no empty blocks (`create_empty_blocks = false`) could halt.

Friendly reminder, we have a [bug bounty
program](https://hackerone.com/tendermint).

### IMPROVEMENTS:
- [pex] [\#3037](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3037) Only log "Reached max attempts to dial" once
- [rpc] [\#3159](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3159) Expose
  `triggered_timeout_commit` in the `/dump_consensus_state`

### BUG FIXES:
- [consensus] [\#3199](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3199) Fix consensus halt with no empty blocks from not resetting triggeredTimeoutCommit
- [p2p] [\#2967](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/2967) Fix file descriptor leak

## v0.29.0

*January 21, 2019*

Special thanks to external contributors on this release:
@bradyjoestar, @kunaldhariwal, @gauthamzz, @hrharder

This release is primarily about making some breaking changes to
the Block protocol version before Cosmos launch, and to fixing more issues
in the proposer selection algorithm discovered on Cosmos testnets.

The Block protocol changes include using a standard Merkle tree format (RFC 6962),
fixing some inconsistencies between field orders in Vote and Proposal structs,
and constraining the hash of the ConsensusParams to include only a few fields.

The proposer selection algorithm saw significant progress,
including a [formal proof by @cwgoes for the base-case in Idris](https://github.com/cwgoes/tm-proposer-idris)
and a [much more detailed specification (still in progress) by
@ancazamfir](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/3140).

Fixes to the proposer selection algorithm include normalizing the proposer
priorities to mitigate the effects of large changes to the validator set.
That said, we just discovered [another bug](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3181),
which will be fixed in the next breaking release.

While we are trying to stabilize the Block protocol to preserve compatibility
with old chains, there may be some final changes yet to come before Cosmos
launch as we continue to audit and test the software.

Friendly reminder, we have a [bug bounty
program](https://hackerone.com/tendermint).

### BREAKING CHANGES:

* CLI/RPC/Config

* Apps
  - [state] [\#3049](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3049) Total voting power of the validator set is upper bounded by
    `MaxInt64 / 8`. Apps must ensure they do not return changes to the validator
    set that cause this maximum to be exceeded.

* Go API
  - [node] [\#3082](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3082) MetricsProvider now requires you to pass a chain ID
  - [types] [\#2713](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/2713) Rename `TxProof.LeafHash` to `TxProof.Leaf`
  - [crypto/merkle] [\#2713](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/2713) `SimpleProof.Verify` takes a `leaf` instead of a
    `leafHash` and performs the hashing itself

* Blockchain Protocol
  * [crypto/merkle] [\#2713](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/2713) Merkle trees now match the RFC 6962 specification
  * [types] [\#3078](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3078) Re-order Timestamp and BlockID in CanonicalVote so it's
    consistent with CanonicalProposal (BlockID comes
    first)
  * [types] [\#3165](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3165) Hash of ConsensusParams only includes BlockSize.MaxBytes and
    BlockSize.MaxGas

* P2P Protocol
  - [consensus] [\#3049](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3049) Normalize priorities to not exceed `2*TotalVotingPower` to mitigate unfair proposer selection
    heavily preferring earlier joined validators in the case of an early bonded large validator unbonding

### FEATURES:

### IMPROVEMENTS:
- [rpc] [\#3065](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3065) Return maxPerPage (100), not defaultPerPage (30) if `per_page` is greater than the max 100.
- [instrumentation] [\#3082](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3082) Add `chain_id` label for all metrics

### BUG FIXES:

It also makes use of the `ConsensusParams.Validator.PubKeyTypes` to restrict the
key types that can be used by validators, and removes the `Heartbeat` consensus
message.

### BREAKING CHANGES:

* CLI/RPC/Config

    - [\#2785](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/2785) Accum for new validators is `-1.125*totalVotingPower` instead of 0
    - [\#2941](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/2941) val.Accum is preserved during ValidatorSet.Update to avoid being
      reset to 0

    - do not batch clip
    - keep accums averaged near 0
- [txindex/kv] [\#2925](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/2925) Don't return false positives when range searching for a prefix of a tag value

## v0.26.0

*November 2, 2018*

Special thanks to external contributors on this release:
@bradyjoestar, @connorwstein, @goolAdapter, @HaoyangLiu,
@james-ray, @overbool, @phymbert, @Slamper, @Uzair1995, @yutianwu.

Special thanks to @Slamper for a series of bug reports in our [bug bounty
program](https://hackerone.com/tendermint) which are fixed in this release.

This release is primarily about adding Version fields to various data structures,
optimizing consensus messages for signing and verification in
restricted environments (like HSMs and the Ethereum Virtual Machine), and
aligning the consensus code with the [specification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04938).
It also includes our first take at a generalized merkle proof system, and
changes the length of hashes used for hashing data structures from 20 to 32
bytes.

See the [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md#v0.26.0) for details on upgrading to the new
version.

Please note that we are still making breaking changes to the protocols.
While the new Version fields should help us to keep the software backwards compatible
even while upgrading the protocols, we cannot guarantee that new releases will
be compatible with old chains just yet. We expect there will be another breaking
release or two before the Cosmos Hub launch, but we will otherwise be paying
increasing attention to backwards compatibility. Thanks for bearing with us!

Special thanks to external contributors on this release:
@scriptionist, @bradyjoestar, @WALL-E

This release is mostly about the ConsensusParams - removing fields and enforcing MaxGas.
It also addresses some issues found via security audit, removes various unused
functions from `libs/common`, and implements
[ADR-012](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/develop/docs/architecture/adr-012-peer-transport.md).

Friendly reminder, we have a [bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/tendermint).

    * The size of block parts in the consensus is now fixed to 64kB

* Apps
  * [mempool] [\#2360](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/2360) Mempool tracks the `ResponseCheckTx.GasWanted` and
    `ConsensusParams.BlockSize.MaxGas` and enforces:
    - `GasWanted <= MaxGas` for every tx
    - `(sum of GasWanted in block) <= MaxGas` for block proposal

* Go API
  * [libs/common] [\#2431](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/2431) Remove Word256 due to lack of use

## 0.24.0

*September 6th, 2018*

Special thanks to external contributors with PRs included in this release: ackratos, james-ray, bradyjoestar,
peerlink, Ahmah2009, bluele, b00f.

This release includes breaking upgrades in the block header,
including the long awaited changes for delaying validator set updates by one
block to better support light clients.
It also fixes enforcement on the maximum size of blocks, and includes a BFT
timestamp in each block that can be safely used by applications.
There are also some minor breaking changes to the rpc, config, and ABCI.

See the [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md#v0.24.0) for details on upgrading to the new
version.

From here on, breaking changes will be broken down to better reflect how users
are affected by a change.

A few more breaking changes are in the works - each will come with a clear
Architecture Decision Record (ADR) explaining the change. You can review ADRs
[here](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/tree/develop/docs/architecture)
or in the [open Pull Requests](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pulls).
You can also check in on the [issues marked as

## 0.23.0

*August 5th, 2018*

This release includes breaking upgrades in our P2P encryption,
some ABCI messages, and how we encode time and signatures.

A few more changes are still coming to the Header, ABCI,
and validator set handling to better support light clients, BFT time, and
upgrades. Most notably, validator set changes will be delayed by one block (see
[#1815][i1815]).

We also removed `make ensure_deps` in favour of `make get_vendor_deps`.

- [privval] fix a deadline for accepting new connections in socket private
  validator.
- [p2p] Allow startup if a configured seed node's IP can't be resolved ([#1716](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/1716))

BREAKING:
 - genesis file: validator `amount` is now `power`
 - abci: Info, BeginBlock, InitChain all take structs
 - rpc: various changes to match JSONRPC spec (http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification), including breaking ones:
    - requests that previously returned HTTP code 4XX now return 200 with an error code in the JSONRPC.
    - `rpctypes.RPCResponse` uses new `RPCError` type instead of `string`.

 - cmd: if there is no genesis, exit immediately instead of waiting around for one to show.
 - types: `Signer.Sign` returns an error.
 - state: every validator set change is persisted to disk, which required some changes to the `State` structure.
 - p2p: new `p2p.Peer` interface used for all reactor methods (instead of `*p2p.Peer` struct).

FEATURES:
 - rpc: `/validators?height=X` allows querying of validators at previous heights.
 - rpc: Leaving the `height` param empty for `/block`, `/validators`, and `/commit` will return the value for the latest height.

- control over empty block production:
  - new flag, `--consensus.create_empty_blocks`; when set to false, blocks are only created when there are txs or when the AppHash changes.
  - new config option, `consensus.create_empty_blocks_interval`; an empty block is created after this many seconds.
  - in normal operation, `create_empty_blocks = true` and `create_empty_blocks_interval = 0`, so blocks are being created all the time (as in all previous versions of tendermint). The number of empty blocks can be reduced by increasing `create_empty_blocks_interval` or by setting `create_empty_blocks = false`.
  - new `TxsAvailable()` method added to Mempool that returns a channel which fires when txs are available.
  - new heartbeat message added to consensus reactor to notify peers that a node is waiting for txs before entering propose step.
- rpc: Add `syncing` field to response returned by `/status`. Is `true` while in fast-sync mode.

IMPROVEMENTS:
- Add a Code of Conduct
- Variety of improvements as suggested by `megacheck` tool

## 0.10.0 (June 2, 2017)

Includes major updates to configuration, logging, and json serialization.
Also includes the Grand Repo-Merge of 2017.

BREAKING CHANGES:

- Config and Flags:
  - The `config` map is replaced with a [`Config` struct](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/master/config/config.go#L11),
containing substructs: `BaseConfig`, `P2PConfig`, `MempoolConfig`, `ConsensusConfig`, `RPCConfig`
  - This affects the following flags:
    - `--seeds` is now `--p2p.seeds`
    - `--node_laddr` is now `--p2p.laddr`
    - `--pex` is now `--p2p.pex`
    - `--skip_upnp` is now `--p2p.skip_upnp`
    - `--rpc_laddr` is now `--rpc.laddr`
    - `--grpc_laddr` is now `--rpc.grpc_laddr`
  - Any configuration option now within a substract must come under that heading in the `config.toml`, for instance:
    ```
    [p2p]
    laddr="tcp://1.2.3.4:46656"

    [consensus]
    timeout_propose=1000
    ```
  - Use viper and `DefaultConfig() / TestConfig()` functions to handle defaults, and remove `config/tendermint` and `config/tendermint_test`
  - Change some function and method signatures to
  - Change some [function and method signatures](https://gist.github.com/ebuchman/640d5fc6c2605f73497992fe107ebe0b) accomodate new config

- Logger
  - Replace static `log15` logger with a simple interface, and provide a new implementation using `go-kit`.
See our new [logging library](https://github.com/tendermint/tmlibs/log) and [blog post](https://tendermint.com/blog/abstracting-the-logger-interface-in-go) for more details
  - Levels `warn` and `notice` are removed (you may need to change them in your `config.toml`!)
  - Change some [function and method signatures](https://gist.github.com/ebuchman/640d5fc6c2605f73497992fe107ebe0b) to accept a logger

- JSON serialization:
  - Replace `[TypeByte, Xxx]` with `{"type": "some-type", "data": Xxx}` in RPC and all `.json` files by using `go-wire/data`. For instance, a public key is now:
    ```
    "pub_key": {
      "type": "ed25519",
      "data": "83DDF8775937A4A12A2704269E2729FCFCD491B933C4B0A7FFE37FE41D7760D0"
    }
    ```
  - Remove type information about RPC responses, so `[TypeByte, {"jsonrpc": "2.0", ... }]` is now just `{"jsonrpc": "2.0", ... }`
  - Change `[]byte` to `data.Bytes` in all serialized types (for hex encoding)
  - Lowercase the JSON tags in `ValidatorSet` fields
  - Introduce `EventDataInner` for serializing events

- Other:
  - Send InitChain message in handshake if `appBlockHeight == 0`
  - Do not include the `Accum` field when computing the validator hash. This makes the ValidatorSetHash unique for a given validator set, rather than changing with every block (as the Accum changes)
  - Unsafe RPC calls are not enabled by default. This includes `/dial_seeds`, and all calls prefixed with `unsafe`. Use the `--rpc.unsafe` flag to enable.


FEATURES:

- Per-module log levels. For instance, the new default is `state:info,*:error`, which means the `state` package logs at `info` level, and everything else logs at `error` level
- Log if a node is validator or not in every consensus round
- Use ldflags to set git hash as part of the version
- Ignore `address` and `pub_key` fields in `priv_validator.json` and overwrite them with the values derrived from the `priv_key`

IMPROVEMENTS:

- Merge `tendermint/go-p2p -> tendermint/tendermint/p2p` and `tendermint/go-rpc -> tendermint/tendermint/rpc/lib`
- Update paths for grand repo merge:
  - `go-common -> tmlibs/common`
  - `go-data -> go-wire/data`
  - All other `go-` libs, except `go-crypto` and `go-wire`, are merged under `tmlibs`
- No global loggers (loggers are passed into constructors, or preferably set with a SetLogger method)
- Return HTTP status codes with errors for RPC responses
- Limit `/blockchain_info` call to return a maximum of 20 blocks
- Use `.Wrap()` and `.Unwrap()` instead of eg. `PubKeyS` for `go-crypto` types
- RPC JSON responses use pretty printing (via `json.MarshalIndent`)
- Color code different instances of the consensus for tests
- Isolate viper to `cmd/tendermint/commands` and do not read config from file for tests


## 0.9.2 (April 26, 2017)

BUG FIXES:

- Fix bug in `ResetPrivValidator` where we were using the global config and log (causing external consumers, eg. basecoin, to fail).

## 0.9.1 (April 21, 2017)

FEATURES:

- Transaction indexing - txs are indexed by their hash using a simple key-value store; easily extended to more advanced indexers
- New `/tx?hash=X` endpoint to query for transactions and their DeliverTx result by hash. Optionally returns a proof of the tx's inclusion in the block
- `tendermint testnet` command initializes files for a testnet

IMPROVEMENTS:

- CLI now uses Cobra framework
- TMROOT is now TMHOME (TMROOT will stop working in 0.10.0)
- `/broadcast_tx_XXX` also returns the Hash (can be used to query for the tx)
- `/broadcast_tx_commit` also returns the height the block was committed in
- ABCIResponses struct persisted to disk before calling Commit; makes handshake replay much cleaner
- WAL uses #ENDHEIGHT instead of #HEIGHT (#HEIGHT will stop working in 0.10.0)
- Peers included via `--seeds`, under `seeds` in the config, or in `/dial_seeds` are now persistent, and will be reconnected to if the connection breaks

BUG FIXES:

- Fix bug in fast-sync where we stop syncing after a peer is removed, even if they're re-added later
- Fix handshake replay to handle validator set changes and results of DeliverTx when we crash after app.Commit but before state.Save()

## 0.9.0 (March 6, 2017)

BREAKING CHANGES:

- Update ABCI to v0.4.0, where Query is now `Query(RequestQuery) ResponseQuery`, enabling precise proofs at particular heights:

```
message RequestQuery{
	bytes data = 1;
	string path = 2;
	uint64 height = 3;
	bool prove = 4;
}

message ResponseQuery{
	CodeType          code        = 1;
	int64             index       = 2;
	bytes             key         = 3;
	bytes             value       = 4;
	bytes             proof       = 5;
	uint64            height      = 6;
	string            log         = 7;
}
```


- `BlockMeta` data type unifies its Hash and PartSetHash under a `BlockID`:

```
type BlockMeta struct {
	BlockID BlockID `json:"block_id"` // the block hash and partsethash
	Header  *Header `json:"header"`   // The block's Header
}
```

- `ValidatorSet.Proposer` is exposed as a field and persisted with the `State`. Use `GetProposer()` to initialize or update after validator-set changes.

- `tendermint gen_validator` command output is now pure JSON

FEATURES:

- New RPC endpoint `/commit?height=X` returns header and commit for block at height `X`
- Client API for each endpoint, including mocks for testing

IMPROVEMENTS:

- Simplified starting Tendermint in-process from another application
- Better organized Makefile
- Scripts for auto-building binaries across platforms
- Docker image improved, slimmed down (using Alpine), and changed from tendermint/tmbase to tendermint/tendermint
- New repo files: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, Github `ISSUE_TEMPLATE`, `CHANGELOG.md`
- Improvements on CircleCI for managing build/test artifacts
- Handshake replay is doen through the consensus package, possibly using a mockApp
- Graceful shutdown of RPC listeners
- Tests for the PEX reactor and DialSeeds

BUG FIXES:

- Check peer.Send for failure before updating PeerState in consensus
- Fix panic in `/dial_seeds` with invalid addresses
- Fix proposer selection logic in ValidatorSet by taking the address into account in the `accumComparable`
- Fix inconcistencies with `ValidatorSet.Proposer` across restarts by persisting it in the `State`


## 0.8.0 (January 13, 2017)

BREAKING CHANGES:

- New data type `BlockID` to represent blocks:

```
type BlockID struct {
	Hash        []byte        `json:"hash"`
	PartsHeader PartSetHeader `json:"parts"`
}
```

- `Vote` data type now includes validator address and index:

```
type Vote struct {
	ValidatorAddress []byte           `json:"validator_address"`
	ValidatorIndex   int              `json:"validator_index"`
	Height           int              `json:"height"`
	Round            int              `json:"round"`
	Type             byte             `json:"type"`
	BlockID          BlockID          `json:"block_id"` // zero if vote is nil.
	Signature        crypto.Signature `json:"signature"`
}
```

- Update TMSP to v0.3.0, where it is now called ABCI and AppendTx is DeliverTx
- Hex strings in the RPC are now "0x" prefixed


FEATURES:

- New message type on the ConsensusReactor, `Maj23Msg`, for peers to alert others they've seen a Maj23,
in order to track and handle conflicting votes intelligently to prevent Byzantine faults from causing halts:

```
type VoteSetMaj23Message struct {
	Height  int
	Round   int
	Type    byte
	BlockID types.BlockID
}
```

- Configurable block part set size
- Validator set changes
- Optionally skip TimeoutCommit if we have all the votes
- Handshake between Tendermint and App on startup to sync latest state and ensure consistent recovery from crashes
- GRPC server for BroadcastTx endpoint

IMPROVEMENTS:

- Less verbose logging
- Better test coverage (37% -> 49%)
- Canonical SignBytes for signable types
- Write-Ahead Log for Mempool and Consensus via tmlibs/autofile
- Better in-process testing for the consensus reactor and byzantine faults

## PreHistory

Strict versioning only began with the release of v0.7.0, in late summer 2016.
The project itself began in early summer 2014 and was workable decentralized cryptocurrency software by the end of that year.
Through the course of 2015, in collaboration with Eris Industries (now Monax Industries),
many additional features were integrated, including an implementation from scratch of the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
That implementation now forms the heart of [Burrow](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow).
In the later half of 2015, the consensus algorithm was upgraded with a more asynchronous design and a more deterministic and robust implementation.

By late 2015, frustration with the difficulty of forking a large monolithic stack to create alternative cryptocurrency designs led to the
invention of the Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI), then called the Tendermint Socket Protocol (TMSP).
The Ethereum Virtual Machine and various other transaction features were removed, and Tendermint was whittled down to a core consensus engine
driving an application running in another process.
The ABCI interface and implementation were iterated on and improved over the course of 2016,
until versioned history kicked in with v0.7.0.
