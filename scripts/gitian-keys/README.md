## PGP keys of Gitian builders and Tendermint Developers

The file `keys.txt` contains fingerprints of the public keys of Gitian builders
and active developers.

The associated keys are mainly used to sign git commits or the build results
of Gitian builds.

The most recent version of each pgp key can be found on most PGP key servers.

Fetch the latest version from the key server to see if any key was revoked in
the meantime.
To fetch the latest version of all pgp keys in your gpg homedir,

```sh
gpg --refresh-keys
```

To fetch keys of Gitian builders and active core developers, feed the list of
fingerprints of the primary keys into gpg:

```sh
while read fingerprint keyholder_name; \
do gpg --keyserver hkp://subset.pool.sks-keyservers.net \
--recv-keys ${fingerprint}; done < ./keys.txt
```

Add your key to the list if you are a Tendermint core developer or you have
provided Gitian signatures for two major or minor releases of Tendermint.
