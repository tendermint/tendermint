# Tendermint

Welcome to the Tendermint Core documentation! Below you'll find an
overview of the documentation.

Tendermint Core is Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) middleware that takes a state
transition machine - written in any programming language - and securely
replicates it on many machines. In other words, a blockchain.

Tendermint requires an application running over the Application Blockchain
Interface (ABCI) - and comes packaged with an example application to do so.
