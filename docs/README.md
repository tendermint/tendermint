# Tendermint

Welcome to the Tendermint Core documentation! The introduction below provides
an overview to help you navigate to your area of interest.

## Introduction

Tendermint Core is Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) middleware that takes a state
transition machine - written in any programming language - and securely
replicates it on many machines. In other words, a blockchain.

Tendermint requires an application running over the Application Blockchain
Interface (ABCI) - and comes packaged with an example application to do so.
Follow the [installation instructions](./install) to get up and running
quickly. For more details on [using tendermint](./using-tendermint) see that
and the following sections.

## Networks

Testnets can be setup manually on one or more machines, or automatically on one
or more machine, using a variety of methods described in the [deploy testnets
section](./deploy-testnets). For more information (and to join) about the
Cosmos Network testnets, see [here](/getting-started/full-node.md).

## Application Development

The first step to building application on Tendermint is to [install
ABCI-CLI](./getting-started) and play with the example applications.
