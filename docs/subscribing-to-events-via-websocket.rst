Subscribing to events via Websocket
===================================

Tendermint emits different events, to which you can subscribe via `Websocket
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket>`__. This can be useful for
third-party applications (for analysys) or inspecting state.

`List of events <https://godoc.org/github.com/tendermint/tendermint/types#pkg-constants>`__

You can subscribe to any of the events above by calling ``subscribe`` RPC method via Websocket.

::

    {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "method": "subscribe",
        "id": "0",
        "params": {
            "query": "tm.event='NewBlock'"
        }
    }

Check out `API docs <https://tendermint.github.io/slate/#subscribe>`__ for more
information on query syntax and other options.

You can also use tags, given you had included them into DeliverTx response, to
query transaction results. See `Indexing transactions
<./indexing-transactions.html>`__ for details.
