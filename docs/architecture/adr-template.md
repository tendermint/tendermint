# ADR {ADR-NUMBER}: {TITLE}

## Changelog

- {date}: {changelog}

## Context

> This section contains all the context one needs to understand the current state, and why there is a problem. It should be as succinct as possible and introduce the high level idea behind the solution.

## Alternative Approaches

> This section contains information around alternative options that are considered before making a decision. It should contain a explanation on why the alternative approach(es) were not chosen.

## Decision

> This section records the decision that was made.
> It is best to record as much info as possible from the discussion that happened. This aids in not having to go back to the Pull Request to get the needed information.

## Detailed Design

> This section does not need to be filled in at the start of the ADR, but must be completed prior to the merging of the implementation.
>
> Here are some common questions that get answered as part of the detailed design:
>
> - What are the user requirements?
>
> - What systems will be affected?
>
> - What new data structures are needed, what data structures will be changed?
>
> - What new APIs will be needed, what APIs will be changed?
>
> - What are the efficiency considerations (time/space)?
>
> - What are the expected access patterns (load/throughput)?
>
> - Are there any logging, monitoring or observability needs?
>
> - Are there any security considerations?
>
> - Are there any privacy considerations?
>
> - How will the changes be tested?
>
> - If the change is large, how will the changes be broken up for ease of review?
>
> - Will these changes require a breaking (major) release?
>
> - Does this change require coordination with the SDK or other?

## Status

> A decision may be "proposed" if it hasn't been agreed upon yet, or "accepted" once it is agreed upon. Once the ADR has been implemented mark the ADR as "implemented". If a later ADR changes or reverses a decision, it may be marked as "deprecated" or "superseded" with a reference to its replacement.
