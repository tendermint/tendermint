# ADR 083: Supporting out of band state sync

## Changelog

- 2022-10-31: Initial Draft (@cmwaters)

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Whenever Tendermint begins, it initiates a handshake with the application via `Info` to gauge version compatibility and receive the last height and app hash of the application. Tendermint then begins a replay protocol which aims to sync the heights of Tendermint's state and block store and the application's current height. 

When initially designed, one invariant was that the applications current height should never exceed
Tendermint's height. The protocol would error and the node would shut down if this were to happen. It seemed
appropriate at the time that Tendermint which would provide blocks either through block sync or consensus
would always be ahead. However, in light of state sync and other protocols for bootstrapping an application to 
a particular height, this invariant is no longer necessary.

## Decision

Allow applications to start with a bootstrapped state alongside an empty Tendermint instance using
a subsystem of the state sync protocol. 

## Detailed Design

Tendermint will perform a protocol to bootstrap to the height of the application under the following circumstances:

- The returned application height is greater than Tendermint's blockstore height
- Tendermint's block store has a height of 0 (i.e. it's empty and we're not overriding an existing instance. This check may be relaxed in the future) 
- State sync is enabled and the config is valid (i.e it contains at least 2 rpc endpoints and a trusted header and hash)

The bootstrap protocol will be run directly after the handshake. It (currently) does not require the p2p layer and will work by updating the `StateStore` and `BlockStore`. It should be performed instead of statesync, moving to either blocksync or consensus once completed.

The protocol mainly wraps around the `StateProvider` which is derived from the `StateSyncConfig` and currently uses the RPC layer and light client to produce a `State` and `Commit` (to be passed to consensus for the next height)

The pseudocode is as follows:
```go
func Bootstrap(sp StateProvider, appHeight int64, appHash []byte, bs BlockStore, ss StateStore) (*State, error) {
    state, err := sp.State(appHeight)
    
    if !bytes.Equal(state.AppHash, appHash) {
        return errors.New("application state hash mismatches block's app hash")
    }

    lastCommit, err := sp.Commit(appHeight)

    err = ss.Bootstrap(state)

    err = bs.SaveSeenCommit(lastCommit)

    return state, err
}
```

## Consequences

### Positive

- This is a non-breaking change
- Applications can now use their own state syncing protocols. This is especially useful when the saved snapshot is already from a trusted node.
- Tendermint will still verify application state in the event that the out of band state does not match the hash of the respective block on chain 

### Negative

### Neutral

- Users will need to have state sync correctly configured and enabled to take advantage of this functionality
