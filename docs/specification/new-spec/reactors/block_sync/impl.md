## Blockchain Reactor

* coordinates the pool for syncing
* coordinates the store for persistence
* coordinates the playing of blocks towards the app using a sm.BlockExecutor
* handles switching between fastsync and consensus
* it is a p2p.BaseReactor
* starts the pool.Start() and its poolRoutine()
* registers all the concrete types and interfaces for serialisation

### poolRoutine

* listens to these channels:
  * pool requests blocks from a specific peer by posting to requestsCh, block reactor then sends
    a &bcBlockRequestMessage for a specific height
  * pool signals timeout of a specific peer by posting to timeoutsCh
  * switchToConsensusTicker to periodically try and switch to consensus
  * trySyncTicker to periodically check if we have fallen behind and then catch-up sync
    * if there aren't any new blocks available on the pool it skips syncing
* tries to sync the app by taking downloaded blocks from the pool, gives them to the app and stores
  them on disk
* implements Receive which is called by the switch/peer
  * calls AddBlock on the pool when it receives a new block from a peer

## Block Pool

* responsible for downloading blocks from peers
* makeRequestersRoutine()
  * removes timeout peers
  * starts new requesters by calling makeNextRequester()
* requestRoutine():
  * picks a peer and sends the request, then blocks until:
    * pool is stopped by listening to pool.Quit
    * requester is stopped by listening to Quit
    * request is redone
    * we receive a block
      * gotBlockCh is strange

## Block Store

* persists blocks to disk

# TODO

* How does the switch from bcR to conR happen? Does conR persist blocks to disk too?
* What is the interaction between the consensus and blockchain reactors?
