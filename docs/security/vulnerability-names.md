# Vulnerability names

Pre-Stargate, Tendermint and Cosmos vulnerabilities used "color" names (e.g. Mulberry, Periwinkle). 
However, these names were not used in order; post-Stargate, we're introducing a new naming scheme
which uses names of _bugs_ (get it?) and will be used in-order.

Here is a list of pre-allocated vulnerability names, to be crossed-out as they are used.
Hopefully we don't make it all the way through the list!
