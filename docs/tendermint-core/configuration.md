# Configuration

Tendermint Core can be configured via a TOML file in
`$TMHOME/config/config.toml`. Some of these parameters can be overridden by
command-line flags. For most users, the options in the `##### main base configuration options #####` are intended to be modified while
config options further below are intended for advance power users.

## Options

The default configuration file create by `tendermint init` has all
the parameters set with their default values. It will look something
like the file below, however, double check by inspecting the
`config.toml` created with your version of `tendermint` installed:

## Empty blocks VS no empty blocks

**create_empty_blocks = true**

If `create_empty_blocks` is set to `true` in your config, blocks will be
created ~ every second (with default consensus parameters). You can regulate
the delay between blocks by changing the `timeout_commit`. E.g. `timeout_commit = "10s"` should result in ~ 10 second blocks.

**create_empty_blocks = false**

In this setting, blocks are created when transactions received.

Note after the block H, Tendermint creates something we call a "proof block"
(only if the application hash changed) H+1. The reason for this is to support
proofs. If you have a transaction in block H that changes the state to X, the
new application hash will only be included in block H+1. If after your
transaction is committed, you want to get a lite-client proof for the new state
(X), you need the new block to be committed in order to do that because the new
block has the new application hash for the state X. That's why we make a new
(empty) block if the application hash changes. Otherwise, you won't be able to
make a proof for the new state.

Plus, if you set `create_empty_blocks_interval` to something other than the
default (`0`), Tendermint will be creating empty blocks even in the absence of
transactions every `create_empty_blocks_interval`. For instance, with
`create_empty_blocks = false` and `create_empty_blocks_interval = "30s"`,
Tendermint will only create blocks if there are transactions, or after waiting
30 seconds without receiving any transactions.

## Consensus timeouts explained

There's a variety of information about timeouts in [Running in
production](./running-in-production.md)

You can also find more detailed technical explanation in the spec: [The latest
gossip on BFT consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04938).

```
[consensus]
...

timeout_propose = "3s"
timeout_propose_delta = "500ms"
timeout_prevote = "1s"
timeout_prevote_delta = "500ms"
timeout_precommit = "1s"
timeout_precommit_delta = "500ms"
timeout_commit = "1s"
```

Note that in a successful round, the only timeout that we absolutely wait no
matter what is `timeout_commit`.

Here's a brief summary of the timeouts:

- `timeout_propose` = how long we wait for a proposal block before prevoting
  nil
- `timeout_propose_delta` = how much timeout_propose increases with each round
- `timeout_prevote` = how long we wait after receiving +2/3 prevotes for
  anything (ie. not a single block or nil)
- `timeout_prevote_delta` = how much the timeout_prevote increases with each
  round
- `timeout_precommit` = how long we wait after receiving +2/3 precommits for
  anything (ie. not a single block or nil)
- `timeout_precommit_delta` = how much the timeout_precommit increases with
  each round
- `timeout_commit` = how long we wait after committing a block, before starting
  on the new height (this gives us a chance to receive some more precommits,
  even though we already have +2/3)
