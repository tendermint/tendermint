# Configuration

Tendermint Core can be configured via a TOML file in
`$TMHOME/config/config.toml`. Some of these parameters can be overridden by
command-line flags. For most users, the options in the `##### main base configuration options #####` are intended to be modified while
config options further below are intended for advance power users.

## Options

The default configuration file create by `tendermint init` has all
the parameters set with their default values. It will look something
like the file below, however, double check by inspecting the
`config.toml` created with your version of `tendermint` installed:

```
# This is a TOML config file.
# For more information, see https://github.com/toml-lang/toml

##### main base config options #####

# or the name of an ABCI application compiled in with the Tendermint binary

# allows them to catchup quickly by downloading blocks in parallel
# and verifying their commits
