# RPC

The RPC documentation is hosted [here](https://tendermint.github.io/slate) and is generated by the CI from our [Slate repo](https://github.com/tendermint/slate). To update the documentation, edit the relevant `godoc` comments in the [rpc/core directory](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/tree/develop/rpc/core).

NOTE: We will be moving the RPC documentation into the website in the near future. Stay tuned!
