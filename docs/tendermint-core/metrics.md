# Metrics

Tendermint can report and serve the Prometheus metrics, which in their turn can
be consumed by Prometheus collector(s).

This functionality is disabled by default.

To enable the Prometheus metrics, set `instrumentation.prometheus=true` in your
config file. Metrics will be served under `/metrics` on 26660 port by default.
Listen address can be changed in the config file (see
`instrumentation.prometheus\_listen\_addr`).

## List of available metrics

The following metrics are available:
