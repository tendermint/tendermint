# Tendermint Remote Testing Scenarios

This folder contains different configurations for Tendermint test network
scenarios, where the focus is to apply these configurations to separate remote
physical or virtual machines and test these configurations under different
stresses.

Specific Tendermint configurations can be found in this folder, each in its own
subfolder. See each subfolder for details of the specific kind of experiment it
represents.
