# Reference Test Network

## Overview
When deployed, this test network spins up 4 nodes running the `kvstore` proxy
app. See the [inventory hosts file](../../inventory/hosts) and the [deployment
playbook](deploy.yml) for details as to which hosts will be targeted.

## Generated Configuration
Beyond the default parameters generated by the `tendermint testnet` command, the
following parameters are updated in the nodes' `config.toml` files:

```toml
proxy_app = "kvstore"
moniker = "<hostname>"
log_format = "json"

[p2p]
# Persistent peers' hostnames are updated accordingly
persistent_peers = "..."

[consensus]
# We turn off the creation of empty blocks
create_empty_blocks = false

[instrumentation]
# We turn on Prometheus support for monitoring
prometheus = true
```

## Custom Parameters
No customisation options are provided for this reference network configuration.
