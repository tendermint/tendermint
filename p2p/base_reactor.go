// Reactor is responsible for handling incoming messages on one or more
// Channel. Switch calls GetChannels when reactor is added to it. When a new
// peer joins our node, InitPeer and AddPeer are called. RemovePeer is called
// when the peer is stopped. Receive is called when a message is received on a
// channel associated with this reactor.
//
// Peer#Send or Peer#TrySend should be used to send the message to a peer.

	// initialize data for the peer (e.g. peer state).

	// the peer. Do not store any data associated with the peer in the reactor
	// itself unless you don't want to have a state, which is never cleaned up.
