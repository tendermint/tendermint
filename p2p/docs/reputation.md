# Peer Strategy

Peers are managed using an address book and a trust metric.
The book keeps a record of vetted peers and unvetted peers.
When we need more peers, we pick them randomly from the addrbook with some
configurable bias for unvetted peers. When we’re asked for peers, we provide a random selection with no bias.

The trust metric tracks the quality of the peers.
When a peer exceeds a certain quality for a certain amount of time,
it is marked as vetted in the addrbook.
If a vetted peer's quality degrades sufficiently, it is booted, and must prove itself from scratch.
If we need to make room for a new vetted peer, we move the lowest scoring vetted peer back to unvetted.
If we need to make room for a new unvetted peer, we remove the lowest scoring unvetted peer -
possibly only if its below some absolute minimum ?

Peer quality is tracked in the connection and across the reactors.
Behaviours are defined as one of:
    - fatal - something outright malicious. we should disconnect and remember them.
        - bad - any kind of timeout, msgs that dont unmarshal, or fail other validity checks, or msgs we didn't ask for or arent expecting
            - neutral - normal correct behaviour. unknown channels/msg types (version upgrades).
                - good - some random majority of peers per reactor sending us useful messages
