Why are they not able to decrease timeout\nin Bitcoin? Because if they would decrease, there would be so many forks that\nthey won't be able to converge to a single chain. By increasing this\ncomplexity and the block time, they're able to have not so many forks. This is\neffectively the timing assumption—the block duration in a sense because it's\nenough time so that the decided block is propagated through the network before\nsomeone else start deciding on the same block and creating forks. It's very\ndifferent from the consensus algorithms in a distributed computing setup where\nTendermint fits. In Tendermint, where we talk about the timing dependency, they\nare really part of this 3-communication step protocol I just explained. We have\nthe following assumption: If the good guys are not able to communicate timely\nand reliably without having message loss within a round, the Tendermint will\nnot make progress—it will not be making blocks. So if you are in a completely\nasynchronous network where messages get lost or delayed unpredictably,\nTendermint will not make progress, it will not create forks, but it will not\ndecide, it will not tell you what is the next block. For termination, it's a\nliveness property of consensus. It's a guarantee to decide. We do need timing\nassumptions. Within a round, correct validators are able to communicate to each\nother the consensus messages, not the transactions, but consensus messages.\nThey need to communicate in a timely and reliable fashion. But this doesn't\nneed to hold forever. It's just that what we are assuming when we say it's a\npartially synchronous system, we assume that the system will be going through a\nperiod of asynchrony, where we don't have this guarantee; the messages will be\ndelayed or some will be lost and then will not make progress for some period of\ntime, or we're not guaranteed to make progress. And the period of synchrony\nwhere these guarantees hold. And if we think about internet, internet is best\ndescribed using such a model. Sometimes when we send a message to SF to\nBelgrade, it takes 100 ms, sometimes it takes 300 ms, sometimes it takes 1 s.\nBut in most cases, it takes 100 ms or less than this.")]),e._v(" "),o("p",[e._v("There is one thing which would be really nice if you understand it.

Because of the complexity and various congestion issues on the network,\nit might happen that during a short period of time, this doesn't hold. If this\ndoesn't hold and you depend on this for correctness of your protocol, you will\nhave a fork. So the partially synchronous protocol, most of them like\nTendermint, they don't depend on the timing assumption from the internet for\ncorrectness. This is where we state: safety always. So we never make a fork no\nmatter how bad our estimates about the internet communication delays are. We'll\nnever make a fork, but we do make some assumptions, and these assumptions are\nbuilt-in our timeouts in our protocol which are actually adaptive. So we are\nadapting to the current condition and this is where we're saying...We do assume\nsome properties, or some communication delays, to eventually hold on the\nnetwork.

From an academic point of\nview, I'm convinced that there is value there. Hopefully, we prove it by\npublishing it on some good conference. What is novel is, if we compare first\nTendermint to this existing BFT problem, it's a continuation of academic\nresearch on BFT consensus. What is novel in Tendermint is that it somehow\nmerges consensus protocol with gossip. This is completely novel idea.\nOriginally, in BFT, people were assuming the single administration domain,\nsmall number of nodes, local area network, 4-7 nodes max. If you look at the\nresearch paper, 99% of them have this kind of setup. Wide area was studied but\nthere is significantly less work in wide area networks. No one studied how to\nscale those protocols to hundreds or thousands of nodes before blockchain. It\nwas always a single administration domain. So in Tendermint now, you are able\nto reach consensus among different administration domains which are potentially\nhundreds of them in wide area network. The system model is potentially harder\nbecause we have more nodes and wide area network. The second thing is that:\nnormally, in bft protocols, the protocol itself are normally designed in a way\nthat has two phases, or two parts. The one which is called normal case, which\nis normally quite simple, in this normal case. In spite of some failures, which\nare part of the normal execution of the protocol, like for example leader\ncrashes or leader being DDoS'd, they need to go through a quite complex\nprotocol, which is like being called view change or leader election or\nwhatever. These two parts of the same protocol are having quite different\ncomplexity. And most of the people only understand this normal case. In\nTendermint, there is no this difference.
